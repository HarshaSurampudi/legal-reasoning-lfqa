In both Jackson and [Ex parte] Godboltl, 546 So.2d 991 (Ala.1987),] the records were sufficient to show that prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination could be made by the defendants; therefore, those cases were remanded for determinations on the issue under the guidelines set out in Bat-son.” 509 So.2d at 1076-77 (second emphasis added). Thus, the Watkins Court established that when nothing in the record supports the bare allegation that a constitutional violation occurred, a court cannot find plain error. See also White v.

    "in the record when there is no indication in the record that the act upon which error is predicated ever occurred (ie., the state’s use of its peremptory challenges to exclude blacks). In both Jackson and [Ex parte] Godboltl, 546 So.2d 991 (Ala.1987),] the records were sufficient to show that prima facie cases of purposeful discrimination could be made by the defendants; therefore, those cases were remanded for determinations on the issue under the guidelines set out in Bat-son.” 509 So.2d at 1076-77 (second emphasis added). Thus, the Watkins Court established that when nothing in the record supports the bare allegation that a constitutional violation occurred, a court cannot find plain error. See also White v. State, 587 So.2d 1218 (Ala.Crim.App.1990), affd, 587 So.2d 1236 (Ala.1991) (<HOLDING>). Cf. Brooks v. State, 929 So.2d 491\n",

    "However, as in Kane, we need not address this issue here because even under the more stringent subjective standard, the evidence ■ supports the Bankruptcy Court's finding that Monson intentionally committed an act that he knew was substantially certain to injure Segundo. See id. Moreover, in light of Kane, the Bankruptcy Court was incorrect that an “intentional tort” is required for nondis-chargeability under § 523(a)(6), See id. Rather, all that is required is that Monson’s behavior was \"willful” and \"malicious,” which the Bankruptcy Court found. Thus, the Bankruptcy Court actually imposed a higher standard than what our case law requires, and it still determined that his actions met that standard. 10 . Monson’s reí janee on our decision in In re Wolfson, 56 F.3d 52 (11th Cir. 1995) (<HOLDING>), is misplaced. In Wolfson, two brothers ran a\n",
