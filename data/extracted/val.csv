"or reopen hearing on the motion. The record is incomplete, but it appears that the trial court had not yet ruled on the initial motion to suppress. As a result, the second motion presented the trial court with the opportunity to correct the alleged error and the State was also provided the opportunity to present the allegedly material witnesses. (See People v. Terrell (1989), 132 Ill. 2d 178, 202.) Accordingly, we conclude that defendant sufficiently raised this issue at trial so as to preclude application of waiver in this instance. (See People v. Harper (1967), 36 Ill. 2d 398, 402 (recognizing error despite the absence of a timely objection in light of the “peculiar circumstances” of case which suggested constitutional infringement); see also In re J.C.

We turn to consider whether the State met","In the given context, did the defendant raise the issue of the allegedly material witnesses adequately at trial?","The defendant has raised the issue of the allegedly material witnesses adequately at trial. The record indicates that the trial court had not yet ruled on the initial motion to suppress, and the second motion provided an opportunity to correct the alleged error and present the material witnesses. In People v. Terrell, it was established that presenting a second motion allows for the correction of alleged errors and provides the State the opportunity to present witnesses. Therefore, in this case, the defendant has sufficiently raised the issue at trial, preventing the application of waiver. This is supported by the precedent set in People v. Harper, where error was recognized despite the absence of a timely objection due to peculiar circumstances suggesting constitutional infringement, and in the case of In re J.C.","Yes, the defendant adequately raised the issue of the allegedly material witnesses at trial in this case, as indicated by the record and supported by legal precedents such as People v.

"145, 149 (Ind.Ct.App.2005). Further, the proposition that a surgeon cannot delegate a duty to remove foreign objects from a patient has been recognized. See, e.g., Miller v. Ryan, 706 N.E.2d 244, 250 (Ind.Ct.App.1999), trans. denied; Indiana Pattern Jury Instruction No. 23.03. Numerous opinions have held that a surgeon is not entitled to summary judgment under such res ipsa cases. See, e.g., Wright, 622 N.E.2d at 172 (affirming the denial of the motions for summary judgment of the surgeon and hospital); Burke v. Capello, 520 N.E.2d 439, 442 (Ind.1988) (reversing the trial court’s grant of summary judgment to a surgeon who left a piece of cement in the patient), overruled on other grounds by Vergara By Vergara v.

The Miller v. Ryan case established that a surgeon cannot delegate the duty to remove foreign objects from a patient. This duty remains with the surgeon as recognized in various other opinions and Indiana Pattern Jury Instruction No. 23.03. Additionally, the Wright and Burke cases held that a surgeon cannot be granted summary judgment in such res ipsa cases. Consequently, based on these precedents and research, it can be concluded that a surgeon is not entitled to summary judgment in a case where a foreign object is left inside a patient.","No, a surgeon cannot be granted summary judgment in a ""res ipsa"" case where a foreign object is left inside a patient, as established by the Miller v.

"of twenty years. Given the district court’s recognition of Barrientos-Maldonado’s “very serious” criminal history, his sentence of fifty-seven months, which is at the low end of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, is not unreasonable. Barrientos-Maldonado also challenges his sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds, arguing that any fact beyond the mere fact of conviction that justifies increased punishment under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2) must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. This claim is precluded by Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224, 226-27, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), and United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, 234 F.3d 411, 414 (9th Cir.2000). Contrary to Barrientos-Maldonado’s challenges, Almendarez-Torres remains good law. See Pacheco-Zepeda, 234 F.3d at 414 (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we reject BarrientosMaldonado’s",Can any fact beyond the mere fact of conviction that justifies increased punishment under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2) be proved beyond a reasonable doubt as per the Sixth Amendment?,"The question pertains to whether any fact beyond the mere fact of conviction that warrants increased punishment under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2) needs to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt under the Sixth Amendment. In the Almendarez-Torres v. United States case, the Supreme Court established that the fact of a prior conviction can be used to justify increased punishment, and this fact need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Subsequently, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda case upheld the ruling in Almendarez-Torres, stating that it remains valid precedent. Therefore, Barrientos-Maldonado's argument that any fact beyond the conviction must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt is precluded by existing case law.","No, according to precedent set in Almendarez-Torres v. United States and United States v. Pacheco-Zepeda, any fact beyond the mere conviction that justifies increased punishment under 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2) does not need to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt under the Sixth Amendment."

"United States after deportation. The parties agree that the government’s failure to allege specific intent rendered the indictment defective under Pemillo-Fuentes. The government asserts, however, that Velasco-Medina waived his objection to the indictment’s sufficiency by failing to raise it before the district court. Velasco-Medina responds that the indictment’s defect deprived the district court of jurisdiction over the case ah initio, and thus requires that we overturn his conviction. We find neither argument availing. The government’s position that Ve-lasco-Medina waived any objection to the indictment’s sufficiency by failing to raise it in the district court has been repeatedly rejected in this Circuit. See, e.g., United States v. Godinez-Rabadan, 289 F.3d 630, 632 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Geiger, 263 F.3d 1034, 1039",Did Velasco-Medina waive his objection to the indictment's sufficiency by not raising it before the district court?,"The question pertains to whether Velasco-Medina waived his objection to the sufficiency of the indictment by not raising it before the district court. The government argues that Velasco-Medina waived this objection, but this argument has been consistently rejected in the Ninth Circuit, as demonstrated in cases like United States v. Godinez-Rabadan and United States v. Geiger. These cases establish that the defectiveness of the indictment can deprive the district court of jurisdiction from the beginning, thus undermining the government's contention. Therefore, Velasco-Medina's failure to raise the objection before the district court does not waive his right to challenge the sufficiency of the indictment.","No, Velasco-Medina did not waive his objection to the sufficiency of the indictment by not raising it before the district court, as established in the Ninth Circuit cases, United States v.

"The debtor is not directly obligated to her minor children for Mr. Sinton’s charges, but this fact is not determinative of discharge. In the case of Silansky v. Brodsky, Greenblatt & Renehan (In re Silansky), 897 F.2d 743 (C.A.4 1990), the Fourth Circuit affirmed the holding of the District Court that attorney’s fees ordered to be paid to attorneys for debtor’s former spouse were within the coverage of § 523(a)(5) and not dischargeable, following the holdings of such cases as Pauley v. Spong (In re Spong), 661 F.2d 6 (C.A.2 1981), that classified fees allowed to a spouse’s attorneys in divorce proceedings as nondisehargeable debts in the category of alimony, maintenance, and support. See Brodsky, Greenblatt & Renehan, Chartered v. Daumit (In re Daumit), 25 B.R. 371 (Bankr.Md.1982) (<HOLDING>); Burns v.

In the case of Silansky v. Brodsky, Greenblatt & Renehan (In re Silansky), the Fourth Circuit upheld the District Court's ruling that attorney's fees owed to the attorneys of the debtor's former spouse fell under the scope of § 523(a)(5) and were not dischargeable. This ruling relied on previous cases like Pauley v. Spong (In re Spong), which categorized fees awarded to a spouse's attorneys in divorce proceedings as nondischargeable debts classified as alimony, maintenance, and support. Furthermore, the case of Brodsky, Greenblatt & Renehan, Chartered v. Daumit (In re Daumit) affirmed the same reasoning. Therefore, even if the debtor is not directly obligated to her minor children for Mr. Sinton's charges, this does not determine whether the charges can be discharged, as shown by legal precedents.","No, whether the debtor is directly obligated to her minor children for Mr. Sinton's charges does not determine the dischargeability of the charges, as established by the cases of Silansky v.

The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' actions under the 1933 Act could have been actionable and serve as evidence of the defendants' overall scheme. This strategy allows the plaintiffs to strengthen their case by showing a consistent pattern of behavior rather than relying solely on the specific claim under the 1933 Act. Therefore, the plaintiffs make these allegations under the 1933 Act to bolster their argument and provide additional support for their claim.","The plaintiffs make allegations under the 1933 Act, even though they do not bring a claim under it, in order to provide additional support for their main claim that the defendants engaged in a consistent scheme of depressing revenue predictions to achieve rapid and sustained growth in share prices.

"court’s order of June 18,1998. When “the evidence as to waiver is a written instrument, its construction and interpretation may be decided as a question of law.” Id. Because a determination of the waiver issues raised by the State does not depend on facts not presented below, but rests on the interpretation of written instruments and the law, we address the State’s arguments raised for the first time on appeal as a matter of law. Defendant’s Pleas of Guilty and No Contest {13} Although Defendant may have waived objections to defects in the proceedings that occurred up to the point of the guilty and no contest pleas, including any right to a speedy trial, he did not waive his objections to subsequent defects in the proceedings.

Therefore, the State's arguments raised for the first time on appeal can be addressed as a matter of law. It is important to note that although the defendant may have waived objections to defects in the proceedings that occurred up to the point of the guilty and no contest pleas, including any right to a speedy trial, the defendant did not waive objections to subsequent defects in the proceedings, as established in State v.

We are mindful that pursuant to section 90.404(1), Florida Statutes (2004), evidence of a victim’s character is “inadmissible to prove action in conformity with it on a particular occasion.” In the instant case, however, the defense did not seek to introduce evidence that Mr. Brown was a drug dealer as an attack upon his character. The defense sought to elicit this testimony to corroborate the defendant’s testimony that he did not go to Mr. Brown’s home to rob him, but instead went there to purchase drugs, and while he was there, Mr. Brown attacked him after he rebuffed his sexual advances.

The court quoted the Land v. United States case, stating that the indictment must provide sufficient information to adequately inform the defendant. In the present case, the specificity of the indictment's allegations meets this requirement, as it fairly apprised the defendant of the crimes he was charged with. Furthermore, it is important to note that the date of the conspiracy was not a substantive element of the crime of conspiracy, so any potential variance would not have affected the defendant's substantial rights.

Therefore, the narcotics officers had a valid basis to execute the stop.","Yes, the illegal u-turn made by the driver of the burgundy Pontiac Grand Am can be considered as a valid basis for the narcotics officers to execute a stop, as it created reasonable suspicion of criminal activity according to the precedent set in United States v.

"to do so may result in a reprimand, a suspension of their license, or a permanent revocation of their license. See Cornell v.

R. 118.10 (discussing discipline by supreme court). It is also significant that the underlying goal of the licensing and supervision of attorneys is to protect the public from the consequences of unqualified legal advisors. See Comm. on Prof'l Ethics & Conduct v. Lawler, 342 N.W.2d 486, 488 (Iowa 1984). These facts unquestionably demonstrate that the attorney licensing requirement has a regulatory purpose. Cf.

This regulation and supervision of attorneys stems from the aim of safeguarding the public against the potential harm caused by unqualified legal advisors, as highlighted in the case Comm. on Prof'l Ethics & Conduct v. Lawler. Thus, it is evident that the licensing requirement for attorneys in Iowa serves a regulatory purpose.","Yes, an attorney can face disciplinary action, such as reprimand, license suspension, or even permanent revocation of their license, for not adhering to the professional code of conduct in Iowa, as established in the Cornell v.

This is supported by cases such as Passantino v. Johnson & Johnson Consumer Products, Inc., where it was recognized that Congress intended to broaden a Title VII plaintiff's choice of forum by expanding the available venues for civil rights violation claims. Therefore, when determining the appropriate venue for a Title VII action, the court must give greater weight to the plaintiff's chosen forum and consider the implications of the venue provision.","Yes, the venue provision of Title VII does command greater deference to a plaintiff's choice of forum and affects the analysis conducted under section 1404(a), as established in cases like Passantino v.

"circumstances are insufficient to meet the standard of reasonable and articulable suspicion that Defendant had knowingly hired or offered to hire his passenger to engage in a sexual act.

This would essentially amount to a seizure of the driver based solely on the presence of a past criminal act committed by the passenger. The court cites State v. Affsprung and State v.

These cases emphasize that an actionable violation of CIPA occurs at the moment the surreptitious recording is made, and the creation of statutory damages for each violation by the California legislature does not require additional injury to be demonstrated. This interpretation is supported by Friddle v. Epstein, which established that the recording itself constitutes a violation of Section 632 of CIPA. Therefore, based on the cited cases and the legislative intent behind creating statutory damages for CIPA violations, it is not necessary to show separate injury aside from a violation of privacy rights in order to claim statutory damages under CIPA.","No, it is not necessary to show separate injury aside from a violation of privacy rights protected by CIPA in order to claim statutory damages, as established by precedent cases such as In re Google Inc. Gmail Litig., Lieberman v. KCOP Television, Inc., and Friddle v. Epstein."
"third issue, which faults trial counsel for failing to ensure a complete record was made of the voir dire. The present record includes only part of the voir dire proceedings, that is, the individual voir dire strikes and final jury selection. During the motion for new trial hearing, counsel said it was his typical practice to have the voir dire recorded and that there was no trial strategy associated with the failure to ensure that a full record was made of voir dire. Mere failure of counsel to request recordation of the voir dire examination is not ineffective assistance of counsel per se. Ybarra v.

The present record only includes partial information on the voir dire, specifically the individual voir dire strikes and final jury selection. During the motion for a new trial hearing, counsel admitted that it was his usual practice to have the voir dire recorded but failed to ensure a complete record in this case. However, there is no evidence of any trial strategy associated with this failure to record the full voir dire. Jurisprudence establishes that the mere failure of counsel to request recording of the voir dire examination does not automatically constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Ybarra v. State and Wills v. State cases demonstrate that the absence of a recording does not per se indicate ineffective counsel. Therefore, the failure to ensure a complete record of the voir dire does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel unless it can be proven that some injury resulted from this failure.","No, trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to ensure a complete record was made of the voir dire, as a mere failure to request the recording of the proceedings does not automatically constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.

"we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency’s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. See Cao He Lin v. DOJ, 428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). Because the IJ found that Veretelnikov was credible and the BIA did not disturb that finding, we assume his credibility. See Yan Chen, 417 F.3d at 271-72. We conclude that the BIA properly reversed the IJ’s grant of the petitioners’ application for asylum. Even assuming that Veretelnikov had established that the treatment he faced at the hands of the Uzbekistani government was on account of a protected ground, he failed to establish that “any future punishment for his failure to perform mandatory military service for which he contracted constitutes persecution.” See In re A-G- 19 I. & N.

In order to determine this, we must consider the agency's reasoning and fact-finding process. If either of these was flawed, the decision may be vacated and remanded for new findings. However, in this case, the IJ found Veretelnikov to be credible and the BIA did not disturb that finding. Therefore, we must assume his credibility. Even if we assume that Veretelnikov's treatment by the Uzbekistani government was on account of a protected ground, he still needs to establish that any future punishment for not performing mandatory military service would constitute persecution. Based on the BIA's decision in In re A-G- 19 I. & N. Dec. 502, it is clear that such punishment does not necessarily constitute persecution. Therefore, the BIA properly reversed the IJ's grant of Veretelnikov's asylum application.","No, Veretelnikov's application for asylum cannot be granted based on his claim of facing punishment for not performing mandatory military service. The BIA's decision in In re A-G- 19 I. & N.

According to Calloway v. District of Columbia, the court has the discretion to award attorney's fees and costs greater than the statutory cap in the District of Columbia. However, the court cannot enforce the payment of any award above the fee cap amount. This means that while the court may grant a higher amount, the actual payment will be limited to the cap. Jackson v. District of Columbia supports this reasoning by limiting recovery to the fee cap amount. Therefore, even if the plaintiff's appropriate hourly rate is calculated based on her bar admission date, the court's ability to award attorney's fees and costs above the cap is constrained.","Yes, the court in the District of Columbia has the discretion to award attorney's fees and costs greater than the statutory cap.

"lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Thereafter, the federal court granted Al-Challah's request and signed Al-Challah's proposed order dismissing her federal claims with prejudice and dismissing her state law elaims without prejudice. A complaint that is voluntarily dismissed is treated as if it never existed and, thus, cannot toll the statute of limitations. Kohlman, 509 N.E.2d at 232. Because Al-Challah voluntarily dismissed her federal lawsuit, her action did not ""fail"" within the meaning of the Journey's Account Statute. Therefore, the trial court did not err by finding that the Journey's Account Statute was not applicable by granting Barger's motion to dismiss Al-Challah's complaint as time barred. See, e.g., id.; cf. City of Evansville v. Moore, 563 N.E.2d 113, 115-116 (Ind.1990) (<HOLDING>). For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the",Can a complaint that is voluntarily dismissed toll the statute of limitations?,"The question pertains to the tolling of the statute of limitations in the case of a voluntarily dismissed complaint. According to the Kohlman case, a complaint that is voluntarily dismissed is considered to have never existed and therefore cannot toll the statute of limitations. The court reasoned that since the complaint is effectively erased, it does not constitute a failure of the action within the meaning of the Journey's Account Statute. Therefore, when Al-Challah voluntarily dismissed her federal lawsuit, her action did not fail to toll the statute of limitations. The City of Evansville v. Moore case supports this interpretation. Based on these legal precedents, it can be concluded that a complaint that is voluntarily dismissed cannot toll the statute of limitations.","No, a complaint that is voluntarily dismissed cannot toll the statute of limitations, as established in the Kohlman and City of Evansville v.

Since the Agreement defines or “pertains to” the employment capacity of the plaintiff, these common law claims fall within the scope of the arbitration clause. The Agreement states that arbitration is appropriate in “any dispute arising under this Agreement to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law.” That would include plaintiffs claim for defamation in violation of state law.

The Agreement between the parties establishes that arbitration is applicable to any dispute arising under the Agreement to the extent allowed by law. The scope of the arbitration clause encompasses claims related to the plaintiff's employment capacity, as stated in the Agreement. Additionally, it is established in the case of McGinnis v. E.F. Hutton & Co. that a claim for defamation in violation of state law falls under the scope of arbitration. Therefore, considering the language of the Agreement and the precedent set by McGinnis v. E.F.

In St. Cyr, the Supreme Court established that a clear statement of congressional intent is required to repeal habeas jurisdiction. As the IIRIRA lacks a clear, unambiguous, and express statement of congressional intent to preclude judicial review of habeas petitions, the Court concluded that the IIRIRA did not eliminate habeas jurisdiction. Several circuit courts, such as the 11th Circuit in Cadet v. Bulger and the 9th Circuit in Singh v. Ashcroft, have similarly held that 28 U.S.C. § 2242(d) of the FARR Act does not provide a sufficiently clear and unambiguous expression of congressional intent to restrict habeas jurisdiction over FARR Act claims. Therefore, it can be reasoned that the IIRIRA does not eliminate habeas jurisdiction in cases brought under the FARR Act.","No, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) does not eliminate habeas jurisdiction in cases brought under the Fugitive Alien Removal Act (FARR Act), as established in St. Cyr and supported by the decisions in Cadet v.

The court in United States v. Dickerson emphasized that an error in the exclusion of evidence is only considered harmless if it had no substantial influence on the outcome of the case and if there is sufficient uninfected evidence supporting the verdict. Additionally, the court in United States v. Haynes held that cumulative evidence, where multiple witnesses testify to the same facts, may be excluded if one witness's testimony is sufficient. Based on these legal principles, if relevant evidence's probative value is outweighed by the aforementioned factors, it can be excluded from the trial proceedings.","Yes, relevant evidence can be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, as outlined in Federal Rule of Evidence 403. The exclusion of evidence should only be considered harmless if it did not significantly influence the case outcome and if there is sufficient uninfected evidence supporting the verdict, as stated in United States v.

These documents suggest that the judgment already accounts for exceptions, exemptions, and means to avoid applying it in cases where it could impair or impede someone's ability to protect their interests. However, the Plaintiff argues against the enforcement of the injunction specifically against him. To determine the validity of Plaintiff's claim, it is essential to differentiate this case from Vasquez v. [Case Name], which dealt with the enforcement of a gang injunction order rather than the order's facial validity.

"Rules “shall be construed to secure the just. . . determination of every action.” The spirit of the Rules favors decisions on the merits, not technicalities, unless the result would be prejudicial to the other party.

In this case, the first three counts of the complaint seek joint recovery, and it serves the interests of justice to interpret Rule 3 and Rule 20 as allowing the commencement of the wrongful death action with the payment of the $185.00 filing fee. However, concerning count four of the plaintiffs' complaint, it alleges a distinct claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, separate from the wrongful death claims.

According to Section 440.49(1) of Florida Statutes, workers' compensation coverage applies when the injury arises out of and in the course of employment. Additionally, Section 440.11(1) states that the employer's liability for such compensation is exclusive, replacing all other liability to the employee. This means that if an employee gets injured in the lobby of their employer, it would likely be considered within the course of employment and fall under the purview of workers' compensation. The employer's liability for compensation would be exclusive, shielding them from other forms of liability. Furthermore, the employer's lack of objection to this practice, as mentioned in Serean v.

"authorized.” As quoted, this language implies that because Vincent’s and Mackey’s decision was “deliberate, considered, or planned,” an inquiry into whether the practice was authorized is irrelevant. This proposition, however, is unsound. First, Piatt’s holding is the far narrower proposition that alleging challenged conduct to be a “matter of consistent policy” is sufficient to withstand attack on Parratt grounds. 773 F.2d at 1034. As alleged, the conduct in Piatt was authorized by state policy, 773 F.2d at 1034; therefore, Parratt does not apply to the conduct, whether deliberate or not. The language quoted by the majority is thus clearly dicta. Even more importantly, the dicta in Piatt is directly contrary to the Supreme Court’s holding in Hudson, 468 U.S. at 533, 104 S.Ct. at 3203 (<HOLDING>). We should follow the Supreme Court. 2.

Piatt v. MacDougall put forth the proposition that alleging challenged conduct to be a ""matter of consistent policy"" is sufficient to overcome attacks on Parratt grounds. However, Piatt's holding is limited to situations where the conduct is authorized by state policy. Therefore, the language quoted in the majority opinion is merely dicta and does not hold weight. Furthermore, the Supreme Court's decision in Hudson v. Palmer establishes that even if the conduct is deliberate, determining whether it was authorized is crucial. As such, it is necessary to consider whether the practice was authorized when assessing the deliberateness, consideration, or planning of a decision.","Yes, it is relevant to inquire whether the practice was authorized when determining if a decision was deliberate, considered, or planned, as established by the Supreme Court's holding in Hudson v.

Dep’t of Protective & Regulatory","If a parent is aware of an environment that creates a potential danger for their child, but disregards it, can they be charged with child endangerment?","The question pertains to whether a parent can be charged with child endangerment if they are aware of an endangering environment but choose to disregard it. According to the case In re S.M.L., endangerment of a child does not require proof of actual harm towards the child, but rather exists when the environment poses a potential danger that the parent is aware of but ignores. In other words, if a parent demonstrates awareness of the endangering environment, it is enough to establish endangerment. This standard was also supported by the cited case of In re Tidwell, which emphasized that certain knowledge of an offense is not necessary for child endangerment, but rather awareness of the potential danger and disregard for that risk is sufficient. Therefore, if a parent knowingly exposes their child to a hazardous environment and disregards the potential danger, they may indeed be charged with child endangerment, even if no actual harm has occurred.","Yes, a parent can be charged with child endangerment if they are aware of an environment that creates a potential danger for their child but choose to disregard it, as supported by the cases of In re S.M.L. and In re Tidwell."
"of the case, because the court treated the Guidelines range as mandatory and “the Supreme Court has now excised the mandatory nature of the Guidelines in Booker.” Shelton, 400 F.3d at 1330 (reviewing Booker claim for plain error). In Shelton, we concluded that “it was Booker error for the district court to sentence Shelton under a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.” Id. (citation omitted). Based on the excision of the mandatory provisions of the Guidelines, in cases involving preserved Booker error, we have required the Government to show that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the Guidelines did not contribute to the defendant’s sentence. See United States v. Paz, 405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). The government bears the burden to show that",How does the excision of the mandatory provisions of the Guidelines in Booker affect sentencing in criminal cases?,"The question pertains to the impact of the excision of the mandatory provisions of the Guidelines in Booker on sentencing in criminal cases. The Shelton case established that the Supreme Court's decision in Booker rendered the Guidelines range as advisory rather than mandatory. It was deemed as Booker error for a district court to sentence a defendant under a mandatory Guidelines scheme. As a result, in cases involving preserved Booker error, the Government is required to demonstrate that the mandatory application of the Guidelines did not contribute to the defendant's sentence. This means that judges now have more discretion in determining sentences, and the Guidelines are merely advisory rather than binding. Therefore, the excision of the mandatory provisions of the Guidelines in Booker has shifted the sentencing landscape in criminal cases.","The excision of the mandatory provisions of the Guidelines in Booker has transformed the sentencing process in criminal cases. The Guidelines range is no longer treated as mandatory, but rather advisory. This means that judges now have greater discretion in determining sentences based on their own judgment and considerations. The Government is now burdened with showing that the mandatory application of the Guidelines did not contribute to the defendant's sentence in cases involving preserved Booker error. This shift has provided more flexibility in sentencing and allows for individualized judgments in criminal cases."

This court takes judicial notice that New",Can an individual be considered as disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) if they are regarded as being unable to perform a narrow range of jobs?,"The question addresses the criteria for determining whether an individual is considered disabled under the ADA based on being regarded as unable to perform a narrow range of jobs. The ADA defines disability as having a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The interpretive guidance provided in 29 C.F.R. Part 1630 clarifies that being regarded as having such an impairment may also qualify as a disability if it substantially limits major life activities. Case law, such as the 4th Circuit's decision in Tyndall v. National Education Centers, Inc., and the 6th Circuit's decision in Sutton v. United Airlines, Inc., have established that being regarded as unable to perform a narrow range of jobs can meet this standard for disability. It has been held that a ""narrow range of jobs"" does not need to be numerically insignificant. Therefore, if an individual is regarded as unable to perform a narrow range of jobs that substantially limits their major life activities, they may be considered disabled under the ADA.","Yes, an individual can be considered disabled under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) if they are regarded as being unable to perform a narrow range of jobs, as established by case law such as Tyndall v.

The defendants argue that the plaintiffs were advised to seek professional assistance, have experts review the documents, and consult other franchisees regarding the risks associated with purchasing the franchise. Additionally, the plaintiffs were explicitly urged to read the agreement with the assistance of legal counsel before signing. This demonstrates that the defendants provided guidance and opportunities for the plaintiffs to fully understand the terms and risks involved in the agreement.

"it does bear on the propriety of fees awarded under § 1988,” id. at 114, 113 S.Ct. 566, and in a concurring opinion, Justice O’Conner wrote that “[wjhen the plaintiffs success is purely technical or de minimis, no fees can be awarded,” id. at 117, 113 S.Ct. 566 (O’Conner, J., concurring). The Court disagrees with defendants’ characterization of plaintiffs victory in this case. First, rather than a nominal sum, the $30,000 in compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury was substantial and easily distinguishable from the cases cited by defendants. See Carroll v. Blinken, 105 F.3d 79, 81-82 (2d Cir. 1997) (affirming district court’s reduction of requested attorneys’ fees because, inter alia, “[tjhere was no damage award”); Pino v.

In Pino, the Second Circuit specifically",Can attorneys' fees be awarded if the plaintiff's victory is deemed to be purely technical or de minimis?,"The issue at hand pertains to the awarding of attorneys' fees when the plaintiff's success is considered to be minimal or purely technical. In the case of Blanchard v.

This is supported by the Carroll v. Blinken case, where attorneys' fees were reduced due to the absence of a damage award. Therefore, in this case, the defendants' characterization of the plaintiff's victory as purely technical or de minimis is not accurate, as the substantial $30,000 compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury set it apart from cases where no damages were awarded.","Yes, attorneys' fees can be awarded, even if the plaintiff's victory is considered to be purely technical or de minimis, as long as the compensatory and punitive damages awarded by the jury are substantial and distinguishable from cases where no damages were awarded, as established in the Blanchard v.

"Miranda warnings was coercive. Notably, Sturdivant does not claim that the officers failed to advise him of the Miranda warnings before any of the interviews, nor does he claim that he did not understand his rights or that his waivers were not knowingly and voluntarily made.

Sturdivant does not direct our attention to any case law, from this court or any other court, in support of his position.

In the case of United States v. Murdock, the court held that the absence of a written Miranda waiver does not automatically make oral waivers or subsequent confessions involuntary due to coercion.

Third, the defendant must have had knowledge of this requirement to appear. Fourth, the defendant must have failed to appear as required. Lastly, the defendant's failure to appear must have been willful. This means that the defendant intentionally and knowingly failed to appear for the judicial proceeding. The case of Weaver v. United States supports this interpretation of willfulness. Therefore, to establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3146, all five elements must be proven.","To establish a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 3146, the government must prove that the defendant (1) was released pursuant to the statute, (2) was required to appear in court, (3) knew that he was required to appear, (4) failed to appear as required, and (5) was willful in his failure to appear, according to the interpretation provided in the case of Weaver v.

Time Insurance Company, 205 F.3d",Can McSperitt file a state law claim to seek recovery of benefits under the plan?,"The issue here is whether McSperitt can file a state law claim to seek recovery of benefits under the plan. According to ERISA, Section 514(a) explicitly supersedes any state laws that relate to employee benefit plans covered by ERISA. Courts have consistently held that ERISA completely preempts state law claims in this regard. Therefore, McSperitt's state law claim for seeking recovery of benefits would be preempted by ERISA, and he would not be able to pursue this kind of claim under state law.","No, McSperitt cannot file a state law claim to seek recovery of benefits under the plan, as ERISA completely preempts such claims."

Therefore, since a shareholder may waive notice by attending a meeting and not objecting, one cannot say that the failure to provide a shareholder with notice of a meeting causes the actions taken at the meeting to be void ab initio. Third, both this Court and our Supreme Court have consistently held that the failure to provide a director with the required notice of a special board meeting renders the actions taken at the meeting voidable — mot void — and thus subject to ratification. See Gordon v. Preston, 1 Watts 385 (Pa.1833) (<HOLDING>); Moller v.

According to the statute, if a person attends a meeting without objection to the lack of proper notice, their attendance constitutes a waiver of notice. This implies that the failure to provide notice does not automatically render the actions taken at the meeting void. Additionally, precedent set by both this Court and the Supreme Court emphasizes that the lack of notice only makes the actions taken at a special board meeting voidable, meaning they can be challenged and potentially invalidated. These actions are subject to ratification.

Compare In re Doe, 964 F. 2d 1325 (CA2 1992) (<HOLDING>); In re Zuniga, 714 F. 2d 632 (CA6) (same),","In this case involving a shooting where there were numerous eyewitnesses, can the trial court still protect the confidential communications between Officer Redmond and his psychotherapist, considering the balance between evidentiary need and privacy interests?","The question pertains to the recognition of a psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501. In this case, the court's assessment was based on the balance between the evidentiary need for the contents of the confidential conversations and Officer Redmond's substantial privacy interests. The court observed that due to the presence of numerous eyewitnesses to the shooting, the evidentiary need for the confidential communications was diminished. Additionally, the court acknowledged the significant privacy interests of Officer Redmond. Consequently, the court concluded that the trial court had made an error by failing to protect the confidential communications between Redmond and his psychotherapist. However, it is important to note that the recognition of psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is not uniformly agreed upon by the United States Courts of Appeals.","Yes, in this case involving a shooting with multiple eyewitnesses, the trial court can still protect the confidential communications between Officer Redmond and his psychotherapist. The court, based on the balance between evidentiary need and privacy interests, concluded that the trial court had erred by not affording protection to these confidential conversations. It should be noted, however, that the recognition of psychotherapist privilege under Rule 501 is not uniformly accepted across all United States Courts of Appeals."
"a. Blackwell Has Alleged a Disability Within the Meaning of the ADA Blackwell must first allege that he has a “disability” within the meaning of the ADA. Swanks, 179 F.3d at 934. The ADA defines a disability as “a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities of [an] individual.” 42 U.S.C. § 12102(1). “The operation of a major bodily function, including ... circulatory ... functions,” is a “major life activity.” Id. § 12102(2)(B). And according to EEOC regulations, the term “substantially limits” is to be “construed broadly in favor of expansive coverage.” 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2; see also 42 U.S.C. § 12102(4)(B)-(E) (generally defining a broad scope for the term “substantially limits”); Green v. American Univ., 647 F.Supp.2d 21, 29 (D.D.C.2009) (<HOLDING>); Johnson v. District of Columbia, 572",Does Blackwell's alleged impairment meet the definition of a disability under the ADA?,"In order for Blackwell's claim to be valid under the ADA, he must first demonstrate that he has a ""disability"" as defined by the law. According to the ADA, a disability is considered as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. The definition specifically includes the operation of major bodily functions such as circulatory functions. Furthermore, the EEOC regulations emphasize that the term ""substantially limits"" should be interpreted broadly to ensure expansive coverage. In support of this, case law also favors a broad interpretation. Therefore, in evaluating Blackwell's case, it is essential to determine whether his alleged impairment meets the definition of a disability as outlined in the ADA.","The determination of whether Blackwell's alleged impairment meets the definition of a disability under the ADA would require an evaluation of whether the impairment constitutes a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, including circulatory functions. Furthermore, it is important to interpret the term ""substantially limits"" broadly in favor of expansive coverage, as specified by the EEOC regulations."
"by participating in a decision to treat all cash received from shares held by the estate in thoroughbred race horses as income rather than creating a depreciating reserve. The circuit court noted that the daughters did not raise this argument until tlieir posttrial brief; thus, it considered the argument untimely. The daughters do not respond to the reason the circuit court gave for rejecting their argument. Instead, they argue on appeal the merits of the issue, which the circuit court did not reach, and they provide no legal authority ■as to the timeliness ground on which the circuit court relied. Based on well settled principles of appellate review, we will not reverse a judgment of a trial court under such circumstances. See, e.g., Tucker v. Nichols, 431 So.2d 1263, 1264 (Ala.1983)(<HOLDING>). D. Award of Attorney Fees to. the Personal",Can the daughters argue for the inclusion of a depreciating reserve in the treatment of cash received from shares held by the estate in thoroughbred race horses?,"The question pertains to the daughters' argument regarding the treatment of cash received from shares held by the estate in thoroughbred race horses. The circuit court deemed the argument untimely since it was raised only in the daughters' posttrial brief. The daughters fail to address the circuit court's reasoning for rejecting their argument and provide no legal authority to challenge the timeliness ground. According to established principles of appellate review, a trial court's judgment will not be reversed under such circumstances. Tucker v. Nichols (1983) exemplifies this precedent. Therefore, the daughters' argument for the inclusion of a depreciating reserve is unlikely to be successful due to procedural grounds and lack of legal authority.","No, the daughters cannot argue for the inclusion of a depreciating reserve in the treatment of cash received from shares held by the estate in thoroughbred race horses as their argument was deemed untimely by the circuit court and they failed to provide legal authority to challenge this decision."
"the premises to serve the common interests of the hotel and defendant. The results of tracking in enough snow and water to create a five-foot puddle were obvious and easily foreseeable; the severity of the harm created by this condition readily apparent; the opportunity to notify of the condition and insure prevention of the obvious danger readily available and the fairness of imposing such duty indisputable. Defendant claims that the custom in the industry precludes the imposition of a duty to notify. Even if it is the custom of a delivery person- not to alert the premises owner of a hazard that he has created, the custom is wrong. See United States v. Carroll Towing Co., 159 F.2d 169, 173, reh’g denied, 160 F.2d 482 (2d Cir.1947); see also The T.J. Hooper, 60 F.2d 737, 740 (2d Cir.)

In this case, the hotel had a duty to serve the common interests of the hotel and the defendant. The severity of harm caused by the condition created by the delivery person was readily apparent and easily foreseeable. The hotel had the opportunity to notify of the condition and prevent the obvious danger. The imposition of such a duty on the hotel is fair and reasonable. Even if there is a custom in the industry for a delivery person not to alert the premises owner of a hazard they have created, this custom is incorrect. The United States v. Carroll Towing Co. case establishes that a custom that goes against the duty to notify is wrong. Therefore, based on these factors and legal precedent, the hotel can be held responsible for injuries caused by the hazardous condition created by a delivery person.","Yes, the hotel can be held responsible for injuries caused by a hazardous condition created by a delivery person because the hotel had a duty to notify of the condition and prevent the obvious danger, regardless of any industry customs.

"and the items that could be seized. The government agents responsible did not minimize intrusions on privacy, however, but instead seized papers and records beyond those the warrant authorized. See United States v. Rettig, 589 F.2d 418, 423 (9th Cir.1978) (concluding that although the warrant was sufficiently particular, the executing “agents did not confine their search in good faith to the objects of the warrant, and that while purporting to execute it, they substantially exceeded any reasonable interpretation of its provisions”). Unlike cases where the magistrate judge erred in filling out the warrant but the government reasonably relied on the judge’s approval, here the magistrate judge properly authorized the warrant but the agents did not follow it. See Hurd, 499 F.3d at 969 (<HOLDING>); United States v. Hitchcock, 286 F.3d 1064",Did the government agents in this case exceed the scope of the warrant while conducting the search and seizure?,"The issue here pertains to whether the government agents went beyond the limitations of the warrant during the search and seizure. In the case of United States v. Rettig, it was determined that the agents involved did not confine their search to the objects specified in the warrant, but instead seized papers and records beyond what was authorized. This constituted a substantial deviation from the reasonable interpretation of the warrant. It is important to note that in situations where the magistrate judge made an error in completing the warrant, but the government relied on the judge's approval in good faith, a different legal analysis applies. However, in this particular case, while the magistrate judge properly authorized the warrant, the agents did not adhere to its provisions. The case of Hurd supports this reasoning.","Yes, in this case, the government agents exceeded the scope of the warrant by seizing papers and records beyond what was authorized, as determined in the United States v. Rettig case."
"firearm in violation of § 5861(d), the court stated: “The term ‘firearm’ is not used in its conventional sense; instead it is specifically defined for purposes of the National Firearms Act.” As the Supreme Court has observed, the National Firearms Act as amended in 1968 “is a regulatory measure in the interest of public safety.” United States v. Freed, 401 U.S. 601, 609, 91 S.Ct. 1112, 28 L.Ed.2d 356 (1971); see United States v. Walsh, 791 F.2d 811, 820 (10th Cir.1986). Contrary to Dwyer’s assertion, possession of an unregistered weapon is not akin to ‘simple’ possession. Rather, the statute making possession of an unregistered weapon illegal is targeted at specific weapons deemed to be particularly dangerous. See United States v. Rivas-Palacios, 244 F.3d 396, 397 (5th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); United States v. Brazeau, 237 F.3d 842, 845",Does possession of an unregistered firearm fall under the category of 'simple' possession?,"The question pertains to the classification of possession of an unregistered firearm and whether it can be considered as 'simple' possession. In the case United States v. Freed, the Supreme Court emphasized that the term 'firearm' should be specifically defined for the purposes of the National Firearms Act, which is a regulatory measure aimed at ensuring public safety. Possession of an unregistered weapon, contrary to the assertion made by Dwyer, cannot be classified as 'simple' possession. The statute making possession of an unregistered weapon illegal specifically targets weapons that are deemed to be particularly dangerous. This is supported by the cases United States v.

The reasonably prudent patient standard requires healthcare professionals to make reasonable efforts to consider the individual circumstances of each patient. They are not expected to be mind readers but must reasonably attend to the specific circumstances of their patients. This standard does not necessitate the disclosure of every risk to any pregnant patient, but it only requires the disclosure of material risks to a reasonable patient. Therefore, physicians and counselors must disclose only those risks that would be considered significant to a reasonable patient. This approach is supported by Kathy Seward Northern's article on Procreative Torts and the case of Jones v. United States.","Physicians and counselors are required to adhere to the reasonably prudent patient standard when disclosing risks to pregnant patients.

Bruch, 489 U.S. 101, 111, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989). The Court held that a denial of benefits challenge under 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B) should be reviewed under a de novo standard unless the benefit plan grants the administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan.

However, where a “website contain[s] no commercial links, but rather contain[s] links to a [website], which in turn contain[s] advertising” or has a commercial purpose, this does not satisfy the “commercial use requirement of the statute.” See Bosley Medical, 403 F.3d at 678; see also TMI, Inc. v.

"rule does not dispose of the case sub judien, however, because Sherwood originally made a motion for judgment at the close of its own evidence, not at the close of its opponent’s evidence. The rationale for holding that merely ""renewing” a motion for judgment does not preserve the issue for appeal is that the original motion for judgment is withdrawn once the party making the motion presents evidence. Smith v. Carr, 189 Md. 338, 56 A.2d 151 (1947); Md. Rule 2-519(c). Because Sherwood had already presented its evidence when it initially moved for judgment, and because it is evident that the reasons for the motion were clear to the trial judge, the issue is preserved. Hartford does not contend otherwise. See Laubach v. Franklin Square Hospital, 79 Md. App. 203, 216, 556 A.2d 682 (1989) (<HOLDING>) (citing Sergeant Co. v.

"could arise if the public construction project was “unreasonably prolonged.” Truck Terminal, 486 Pa. at 23 n. 8, 403 A.2d at 989 n. 8. In the temporary-obstruction scenario, therefore, the essential difficulty lies in ascertaining when the infringement upon reasonable access becomes unduly prolonged, or is otherwise accomplished in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner. Clearly, if the governmental entity arbitrarily obstructs access to the subject property in the sense that the interference is unnecessary and the project could have been completed just as conveniently without substantial harm to any property owner, the situation would come within the exception to the Truck Terminal rule for arbitrary deprivations. Cf. L-M-S Inc. v. Blackwell, 149 Tex. 348, 233 S.W.2d 286, 289-90 (1950) (<HOLDING>). Presently, however, although Ap- pellees",Can a governmental entity be held liable for arbitrary obstruction of access to property in a public construction project?,"The question raises the issue of governmental liability for arbitrary obstruction of access to property during a public construction project. According to the Truck Terminal case, if the infringement upon reasonable access becomes unduly prolonged or is accomplished in an arbitrary and unreasonable manner, it may give rise to a claim. To determine if the obstruction is arbitrary, it must be shown that the interference is unnecessary and that the project could have been completed without substantial harm to any property owner. The L-M-S Inc. case supports this reasoning by establishing that arbitrary deprivations are exceptions to the Truck Terminal rule. Therefore, if the governmental entity's obstruction of access is found to be unnecessary and could have been avoided without causing harm to property owners, they may be held liable for the arbitrary obstruction.","A governmental entity may be held liable for arbitrary obstruction of access to property in a public construction project if the obstruction is unnecessary and the project could have been completed without substantial harm to any property owner, as established in the Truck Terminal case. This exception to the general rule holds that arbitrary deprivations are not permissible. The L-M-S Inc. case further supports this exception."
"must terminate with the trust.” Brief of Appellant at 18. Plaintiff recognizes that the district court relied on Pennsylvania bankruptcy cases contrary to her position, but argues that the courts that decided those cases “failed to consider that they were expanding the scope of spendthrift protection beyond that provided for by state law.” Brief of Appellant at 22. The district court explained that the apparent split of authority does not support the bankruptcy court’s conclusion that the principal here is unprotected because Pennsylvania law alone controls this case. As the district court recognized, Pennsylvania law protects remainder interests in the corpus of a trust if the spendthrift provision of the trust instrument so provides. See Clark, 411 Pa. at 256, 191 A.2d at 420 (<HOLDING>); In re Blanchard, 201 B.R. at 126 (applying",Can the plaintiff argue that the Pennsylvania bankruptcy cases failed to consider the expansion of spendthrift protection beyond state law?,"The issue at hand is whether the Pennsylvania bankruptcy cases failed to consider the expansion of spendthrift protection beyond state law. The plaintiff argues that the courts that decided those cases did not take into account the fact that they were expanding the scope of spendthrift protection beyond what is provided by state law. However, the district court disagreed with this argument and stated that the apparent split of authority does not support the bankruptcy court's conclusion. The district court pointed out that Pennsylvania law protects remainder interests in the corpus of a trust if the spendthrift provision of the trust instrument provides for it. This was established in the Clark case, where it was held that Pennsylvania law protects remainder interests if the trust instrument includes a spendthrift provision. Therefore, the plaintiff's argument that the Pennsylvania bankruptcy cases failed to consider the expansion of spendthrift protection beyond state law is not valid.","No, the plaintiff cannot argue that the Pennsylvania bankruptcy cases failed to consider the expansion of spendthrift protection beyond what is provided by state law.

"that the Bureau’s own regulations indicate that it does not pay for “household work related to the individual,” which the federal regulation expressly contemplates as a component of companionship services. See Ohio Admin. Code § 4123-7-25(F) (denying compensation for household duties). We reject these arguments for two reasons. First, we find persuasive the rationale of the court in Lott, 746 F.Supp. at 1087-88, which drew on the exemption’s legislative history to hold that “domestic service employment” simply means being “employed in a private home.” Because Ms. Salyer renders her services to Mr. Salyer almost entirely within their home, she is undoubtedly engaged in domestic service employment to provide companionship services to her disabled husband. Cf. Linn, 891 F.Supp. at 578-79 (<HOLDING>). Moreover, as heretofore indicated, the",Can Ms. Salyer receive compensation for the household work related to her disabled husband as part of the companionship services she provides?,"The question pertains to whether Ms. Salyer can receive compensation for household work related to her disabled husband as part of the companionship services she provides. According to the Ohio Administrative Code § 4123-7-25(F), the Bureau does not pay for household work related to the individual in the context of companionship services. However, the court in Lott v. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics determined that ""domestic service employment"" refers to being employed in a private home based on the exemption's legislative history. Since Ms. Salyer provides her services to her disabled husband primarily within their home, she can be considered to be engaged in domestic service employment while providing companionship services to her husband. Therefore, she may be eligible to receive compensation for household work related to her disabled husband as part of the companionship services she provides.","Yes, Ms. Salyer may receive compensation for the household work related to her disabled husband as part of the companionship services she provides, based on the court's interpretation of ""domestic service employment"" in the Lott case and the lack of explicit prohibition in the Ohio Administrative Code."

The trial court asked during closing argument whether the sole issue was the exigent circumstances question, and neither the prosecutor nor defense counsel corrected the court’s impression. After the trial court orally ruled in favor of the State on the exigent circumstances question, defense counsel asked to clarify several points. None of the matters sought to be clarified involved the pretext issue sought to be argued here, and counsel did not request that the trial court rule on this issue. Under these circumstances we hold that Defendants failed to preserve this issue for appellate review. Cf. State v.

However, some argue that Wyser-Pratte represents the minority rule, as other circuits have adopted a different stance. For example, the First Circuit in Glater v. Eli Lilly & Co. seemed to support the idea of a forfeiture rule, while the Tenth Circuit in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Boellstorff and the Ninth Circuit in In re Hanford Nuclear Reservation Litig. took a different position, aligning with Wyser-Pratte. Ultimately, it will be necessary to analyze which rule the specific jurisdiction follows to determine the plaintiffs' options.","The plaintiffs may have the option to join a class action lawsuit instead of proceeding with their own individual lawsuit, depending on the jurisdiction and the applicable rule. The case of Wyser-Pratte established that plaintiffs should be able to choose between these options. However, different circuits have taken varying positions on this issue, with some supporting the Wyser-Pratte approach and others adopting a different rule.

In cases such as In re Jones and Davenport, it has been held that a claim is not available when the settled law of the circuit or the Supreme Court has established the legality of the conviction. Therefore, based on this reasoning, it is possible to make a claim of innocence in a case involving the transportation of drugs between Guam and another United States territory, even though the Ramirez-Ferrer decision suggests otherwise.","Yes, a claim of innocence can be made in a case involving the transportation of drugs between Guam and another United States territory, despite the ruling in United States v.

"States v. Collins, the sentencing court provided three grounds for its downward departure, two of which—the defendant’s age and infirmity—were discouraged factors. See id. at 1305.

See United States v. Jones, 158 F.3d at 501 (recognizing that, although the defendant’s support in the community was insufficiently “extraordinary” to support a departure on this basis alone, a district court did not abuse its discretion by relying on this factor as one of several grounds supporting a departure); United States v.

In the case of United States v. Collins, the sentencing court provided three grounds for its downward departure, two of which were discouraged factors - the defendant's age and infirmity. The Tenth Circuit's analysis in United States v. Jones acknowledged that a discouraged factor, when combined with other factors, can be used as grounds for departure without requiring it to reach the same level of atypicality as it would if it were the sole basis for departure. This means that while a discouraged factor might not be extraordinary enough to support a departure on its own, it can still be utilized as one of several factors supporting a departure. Furthermore, the case United States v. Pena also supports this reasoning.","Yes, a sentencing court can consider discouraged factors as grounds for downward departure in a sentence, as established in United States v.

"plain meaning of a clear statutory text.

Furthermore, the dismissal of a case due to non-compliance with the claims presentation procedure is not to be treated as a dismissal with prejudice, allowing claimants to refile the action once they comply with the procedure.

First, Mr. Valenzuela argues that he waived his right to appeal in his written plea agreement and therefore had no tribal court remedies to exhaust. We agree with the district court that Mr. Valenzuela’s appeal waiver does not excuse his failure to pursue habeas corpus relief in the tribal court. The appeal waiver did not expressly waive Mr. Valenzuela’s right to collaterally attack his conviction in tribal court. See United States v.

Mr. Valenzuela argues that his appeal waiver in the written plea agreement excused him from pursuing habeas corpus relief in the tribal court. However, the district court correctly determined that the appeal waiver does not waive Mr. Valenzuela's right to collaterally attack his conviction in tribal court. The United States v. Cockerham case supports this reasoning by stating that the exhaustion of tribal court remedies includes the collateral attack. Therefore, Mr. Valenzuela still had tribal court remedies to exhaust, and any further attempts to do so would not be futile as he claims.","No, Mr. Valenzuela has not exhausted all tribal court remedies and can not file a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in tribal court, as determined by the district court and supported by the United States v.

"criminal convictions and, thus, support the conclusion that the prosecution of the resisting arrest charge ended in plaintiffs favor. Under similar circumstances, other courts have found no bar to a malicious prosecution claim. See, e.g., Ahern v. City of Syracuse, 411 F.Supp.2d 132, 151 (N.D.N.Y.2006) (permitting malicious prosecution claim for resisting arrest charge to proceed despite finding of probable cause as to skateboarding and unlawful possession of marijuana charges); Kavazanjian v.

City of White Plains, No.",Can the plaintiff file a malicious prosecution claim despite facing a criminal conviction for other charges related to the same incident?,"The question pertains to the viability of a malicious prosecution claim in the presence of a criminal conviction for other charges stemming from the same incident. Courts have held that a malicious prosecution claim may still proceed even if the plaintiff has been convicted for unrelated charges. In cases such as Ahern v. City of Syracuse and Kavazanjian v. Rice, courts allowed the malicious prosecution claims to proceed despite there being a finding of probable cause or convictions for other charges. The rationale behind this is that the successful prosecution of one charge does not automatically bar a separate malicious prosecution claim for a different charge. Therefore, in this scenario, the plaintiff could potentially file a malicious prosecution claim despite facing a criminal conviction for other charges related to the same incident.","Yes, the plaintiff can file a malicious prosecution claim despite facing a criminal conviction for other charges related to the same incident, based on precedents such as Ahern v.

Finally, In-tamex and Amaleo observe that the evidence indicated that Hawkspere paid ICTS no commission on the freight that ICTS collected for Hawkspere. Appellants’ Br. at 20. This fact, though, cuts directly against agency, since it indicates that Hawkspere and ICTS lacked any formal relationship at all. On this record, the court was correct to conclude that there was no triable issue of fact as to whether ICTS acted as an actual or apparent agent for Hawkspere when it accepted payment from Intamex and Amaleo. VI. Given that ICTS was not Hawkspere’s agent, it remains only to be determined whether there exists any other basis on which the Shippers might be excused from their liability ., 693 F.Supp. 80, 84 (S.D.N.Y.1988) (<HOLDING>). Thus, under the approach taken by the Sixth",Can the Shippers be excused from their liability if ICTS was not acting as an actual or apparent agent for Hawkspere when it accepted payment from the Shippers?,"The question concerns the liability of the Shippers in a situation where ICTS was not acting as an agent for Hawkspere. The court correctly concluded that there was no triable issue of fact as to whether ICTS acted as an actual or apparent agent for Hawkspere when it accepted payment from the Shippers. This conclusion was based on the evidence presented, including the lack of a commission paid by Hawkspere to ICTS on the freight collected. Therefore, if ICTS was not acting as an agent for Hawkspere, another basis needs to be established to excuse the Shippers from their liability.",The liability of the Shippers cannot be excused solely on the basis that ICTS was not acting as an actual or apparent agent for Hawkspere when it accepted payment from the Shippers. Another basis needs to be established to excuse the Shippers from their liability.
"The EEOC interpretive guidance gives as an example of ""broad range of jobs in various classes”: [A]n individual has an allergy to a substance found in most high rise office buildings, but seldom found elsewhere, that makes breathing extremely difficult. Since this individual would be substantially limited in the ability to perform the broad range of jobs in various classes that are conducted in high rise office buildings within the geographical area to which he or she has reasonable access, he or she would be substantially limited in working. 29 C.F.R. Pt. 1630, App. § 1630.2(j). 12 . The Seventh Circuit has held that truck driving constitutes a class of jobs. Best v. Shell Oil Co., 107 F.3d 544, 548 (7th Cir.1997); see also DePaoli v.

According to the EEOC interpretive guidance, if an individual's allergy to a substance found in high rise office buildings significantly impairs their ability to breathe and perform a wide range of jobs in various classes within the geographical area accessible to them, they would be considered substantially limited in working. This interpretation implies that the individual's allergy hampers their ability to perform essential job functions across multiple classes of jobs. Additionally, the Seventh Circuit has established that truck driving is one such class of jobs. Therefore, if the individual's allergy prevents them from performing the broad range of jobs in various classes conducted in high rise office buildings, including truck driving, they can be deemed substantially limited in working.","Yes, an individual with an allergy to a substance found in high rise office buildings can be considered substantially limited in working if they are unable to perform the wide range of jobs in various classes conducted in such buildings, as per the EEOC interpretive guidance and the precedent set by the Seventh Circuit."

The United States v. Gonzales case and LaFrance v. Bohlinger case provide clear legal precedents that due process does not allow a defendant to be convicted based on coerced testimony, whether it is their own confession or a confession obtained through coercion from another party. This principle is grounded in the idea that coerced testimony undermines the integrity of the legal process and violates an individual's right to a fair trial. The McMillian v. Johnson case further supports this reasoning. Additionally, the Webb v. Texas case established that convictions based on coerced evidence violate the defendant's rights.

Counsel for Plaintiff Townsend replied that the plaintiffs had insisted on AstraZeneca paying a larger sum to better represent the losses of the entire class, including those class members who would never claim their recovery. The district court’s approval reflected another important concern: facilitating a settlement in a hard-fought, complex class action. See Durrett v.

"Univ., 979 F.2d 552, 553 (7th Cir.1992). In this case, there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Mr. Zakaras’ claims were filed within 300 days of the discriminatory act. The “accrual date” of a plaintiffs claim is the date on which the statute of limitations begins to run. Cada v. Baxter Healthcare Corp., 920 F.2d 446, 450 (7th Cir.1990). In cases of alleged discriminatory demotion (or termination), the period begins to run on the date the employee is notified that he will be demoted. See Delaware State College v.

"to confront the witnesses against him. Mississippi Rule of Evidence 901(a) provides: General Provision. The requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the matter in question is what its proponent claims. ¶ 14. The State argues that the passports needed no authentication because they are authentic on their face. The State concedes that the passport of Robert Keys was obtained through a fraudulent application because Bob used an alias to obtain the passport. We do not agree that a fraudulently obtained passport could be considered authentic on its face for the purposes of establishing the information contained within as factual. See U.S. v. Weiss, 491 F.2d 460, 466 (2nd Cir.1974) (<HOLDING>); Gulotta v. United States, 118 F.2d 683, 685",Is a fraudulently obtained passport considered authentic on its face for the purpose of establishing the information contained within as factual?,"The question revolves around the authentication requirement for admissibility of evidence, specifically in relation to a fraudulently obtained passport. According to Mississippi Rule of Evidence 901(a), authentication or identification is necessary for the admission of evidence. The State argues that the passports in question need no authentication as they are authentic on their face. However, it is important to note that the passport of Robert Keys was fraudulently obtained using an alias. This brings into question the authenticity of the passport and the information contained within. Case law, such as U.S. v. Weiss and Gulotta v. United States, has established that a fraudulently obtained passport cannot be considered authentic on its face. Therefore, the information contained within such a passport cannot be automatically treated as factual without proper authentication.","No, a fraudulently obtained passport cannot be considered authentic on its face for the purpose of establishing the information contained within as factual."
"state actor deprived him of a pro tected property interest without due process of law. See Doherty v. City of Chicago, 75 F.3d 318, 322 (7th Cir.1996). The District argues that (1) Kiser did not have a property interest in his continued employment and, (2) even if he had such an interest, his own allegations establish that his due process rights were not violated. As to the first argument, the critical question is whether Kiser had a “legitimate claim of entitlement” to continued employment. Thornton v. Barnes, 890 F.2d 1380, 1386 (7th Cir.1989) (quoting Bd. of Regents of State Coll. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). Every contract that limits the reasons an employee may be terminated creates such an entitlement. See Roth, 408 U.S. at 578, 92 S.Ct. 2701 (<HOLDING>). Kiser’s contract was to last through June 30,","Did Kiser have a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment, and were his due process rights violated?","The question revolves around two arguments made by the District. Firstly, whether Kiser had a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment, and secondly, whether his due process rights were violated. In Thornton v. Barnes, it is stated that a ""legitimate claim of entitlement"" to continued employment exists when a contract is in place that limits the reasons for termination. As per Roth v. Board of Regents of State Colleges, every contract of this nature creates such an entitlement. Since Kiser had a contract scheduled to last until June 30, and if this contract limited the reasons he could be terminated, it can be concluded that he had a legitimate claim of entitlement. Moving on to the violation of due process rights, Kiser's own allegations need to be examined. If his allegations do not establish a violation of due process rights, the District's argument will hold.","Yes, Kiser had a legitimate claim of entitlement to continued employment based on his contract, and the determination of whether his due process rights were violated is dependent on whether his own allegations support this claim."
"lesser included offense. State v. Espinosa, 686 So.2d 1345 (Fla.1996). However, in State v. Von Deck, 607 So.2d 1388 (Fla.1992), our Supreme Court held that an instruction cannot be given on a permissive lesser included offense unless both the accusatory pleading and the evidence at trial support the commission of that lesser included offense. Here, the information filed against Donovan alleged the charge of kidnapping as follows: COUNT 1: In the County of BRE-VARD, State of Florida, on July 11, 1999, Michael Curtis Donovan, did forcibly, secretly or by threat, confine abduct or imprison another person [K.B.] ag conviction because it was error for the trial court to instruct the jury on that permissive lesser included offense. See Torrence v. State, 440 So.2d 392 (Fla. 5th DCA 1983)(<HOLDING>). Donovan also argues that he was entitled to","In Florida, can the trial court instruct the jury on a permissive lesser included offense if the accusatory pleading and evidence at trial do not support the commission of that offense?","The question pertains to whether the trial court can provide jury instructions on a permissive lesser included offense in Florida. The Supreme Court of Florida, in State v. Von Deck, established that such an instruction cannot be given unless both the accusatory pleading and the evidence presented during the trial support the commission of the lesser included offense. This means that in order for the trial court to instruct the jury on a permissive lesser included offense, it must be substantiated by both the charging document and the facts presented at trial. In the case of Michael Curtis Donovan, the information filed against him specifically alleged the charge of kidnapping and did not support the inclusion of a permissive lesser included offense instruction. Therefore, it can be concluded that the trial court erred in instructing the jury on a permissive lesser included offense in this case, as supported by the Torrence v. State precedent.","No, the trial court cannot instruct the jury on a permissive lesser included offense in Florida if the accusatory pleading and evidence at trial do not support the commission of that offense. This was established in the Von Deck case and is supported by the Torrence v. State precedent."
"(addition) claim was excluded under exclusion “m.” Id. at 92. We conclude that exclusion “m” applies to the homeowners’ negligent-construction (addition) claim because the damage claimed was to addition work performed entirely by RDI. But the negligent-construction (original house) claim is not excluded by paragraph “m.” Specifically, the work performed on the original house by RDI was limited to the remodel and installation of the master bedroom window and other trim work. We read exclusion “m” to exclude the work performed by RDI on portions of the original house but exclusion “m” does not apply to adjacent walls and structures that had moisture damage caused by the work performed by RDI. See, e.g., Brown v. Concord, Grp. Ins. Co., 163 N.H. 522, 44 A.3d 586, 589-90 (2012) (<HOLDING>); Mut. of Enumclaw Ins. Co. v.

The court's decision in Brown v. Concord, Grp. Ins. Co. clarified that exclusion ""m"" applies to claims for damage to addition work performed entirely by the construction company. In this case, the damage claimed by the homeowners is related to the addition work performed solely by RDI, so exclusion ""m"" would apply to this part of their claim. However, the court also established that exclusion ""m"" does not extend to adjacent walls and structures that have moisture damage caused by the work performed by RDI. Therefore, while the claim for negligent construction of the homeowners' original house may not be excluded under exclusion ""m,"" the damage to adjacent walls and structures caused by RDI's work can still be considered as part of their claim.","No, the homeowners' claim for negligent construction of their original house cannot be excluded under exclusion ""m"" in the insurance policy according to the court's interpretation in the Brown v.

"Moore also took steps to try 5 F.2d at 550; RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF CONTRACTS § 237). To the contrary, Morganti readily conceded that it always maintained sufficient funding for critical path work and that there was never a time when it lacked sufficient funding to proceed. Mr. Menefee, Morganti’s contract administrator, testified that Morganti never allowed its difficulties with getting money for CPC’s and modifications to affect critical path work, and that Morganti always provided funding necessary to pay the subcontractors. In fact, Morganti conceded on summary judgment that the FBOP’s payment errors never delayed Morganti. Thus, money was not the source of its inability to complete the contract work on time. D.W. Sandau Dredging, 96-1 BCA ¶ 28,064, at 140,161-62, 1995 WL 739023 (<HOLDING>). Morganti argues that its ability to perform",Did Morganti's financial difficulties contribute to its inability to complete the contract work on time?,"The question pertains to whether Morganti's financial difficulties played a role in its failure to complete the contract work within the specified timeframe. Morganti's contract administrator, Mr. Menefee, testified that the company consistently maintained sufficient funding for critical path work and never lacked the necessary funds to proceed. Morganti also acknowledged that the payment errors by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (FBOP) did not cause any delays. Therefore, it can be inferred that money was not the underlying cause of Morganti's inability to complete the contract work on time. This is supported by the case of D.W. Sandau Dredging, which establishes that monetary issues are not necessarily a contributing factor to a contractor's failure to meet contractual obligations.","No, Morganti's financial difficulties did not contribute to its inability to complete the contract work on time, as evidenced by testimony from Mr. Menefee and supported by the D.W.

"Nearly every case cited by the parties agrees, as does this court, that some funds must be spent on response costs prior to a declaratory judgment action being considered ripe. The Ninth Circuit, for example, has indicated that both sections 113(g)(2) and 107(a) “envision that, before suing, CERCLA plaintiffs will spend some money responding to an environmental hazard.” In re Dant & Russell, 951 F.2d at 249. Then, and only then can CERCLA plaintiffs “go to court and obtain ... a declaration that the responsible party will have continuing liability for the cost of finishing the job.” Id. at 249-50. “By requiring a plaintiff to take some positive action before coming to court,” the Ninth Circuit explains, “CERCLA ensures that the dispute will be ripe for judicial review.” Id. at 250 (<HOLDING>). See also Trimble, supra, slip op. at 10",Why is it necessary for CERCLA plaintiffs to spend money on response costs before filing a declaratory judgment action?,"The question pertains to the requirement of spending funds on response costs prior to initiating a declaratory judgment action under CERCLA. The Ninth Circuit has established that both sections 113(g)(2) and 107(a) of CERCLA envision that CERCLA plaintiffs must incur expenses in responding to an environmental hazard before pursuing legal action. This precedent is based on the notion that plaintiffs should take proactive steps and incur costs to address the environmental issue before seeking a judicial declaration regarding the responsible party's liability for completion costs. By necessitating plaintiffs to take affirmative actions before resorting to litigation, CERCLA ensures that the dispute is ripe for judicial review. Therefore, the expenditure of funds on response costs serves as a prerequisite for a CERCLA plaintiff to have a case ready for adjudication.",CERCLA plaintiffs are required to spend money on response costs before initiating a declaratory judgment action because this provision ensures that the dispute is ripe for judicial review and that plaintiffs have taken proactive measures to address the environmental hazard in question.

"after the fact, the conduct for which the defendant is accountable includes all conduct relevant to determining the offense level for the underlying offense that was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the defendant.” U.S.S.G. § 1B1.3, Application Note 10. Therefore, reading Application Note 10 in isolation would extend the reasonable-knowledge requirement to all conduct used to determine the sentence for the underlying offense, not only specific offense characteristics. Other circuits are split on how to resolve this apparent contradiction. Supporting Mrs. Lang’s position, the Fifth and Sixth Circuits allow a sentencing court to consider only those drug quantities of which the defendant knew or should have known. See United States v. Warters, 885 F.2d 1266 (5th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

In cases such as Mack, Pettigrove, Peter, Cantrell, and Holmes, hospitals have been found to inform patients through consent forms, signs, and other means that the physicians treating them are independent contractors and not employees of the hospital. This notice serves to establish the hospital's position that they are not responsible for the actions of these independent contractor physicians. Based on these precedents, if a hospital has properly informed the patient about the independent contractor status of the physician providing treatment, the hospital may not be held liable for the actions of such physician.","No, a hospital may not be held liable for the actions of a physician who is an independent contractor if the hospital has properly notified the patient of the physician's independent contractor status, as established in cases such as Mack, Pettigrove, Peter, Cantrell, and Holmes."
"entitled to relief from the district court’s judgment under Rule 60(b)(6) because the court’s dismissal order violated his Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.

Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009), usurped the jury’s fact-finding role. We cannot agree. Whether to grant a Rule 60(b)(6) motion is within the district court’s sound discretion. Cano v. Baker, 435 F.3d 1337, 1342 (11th Cir.2006) (per curiam). Yeyille has shown no exceptional circumstance that warrants relief. A plaintiffs right to a jury trial is not violated merely because his ease is dismissed before trial. See Garvie v. City of Ft.

There is no requirement to conduct a jury","Did the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint under the ""dogma"" of Ashcroft v.

Under Rule 60(b)(6), the decision to grant relief from a judgment lies within the discretion of the district court. In this case, Yeyille argues that the court's dismissal order, based on the precedent set in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, undermined the fact-finding role of the jury. However, Yeyille has not presented any exceptional circumstances that would warrant relief under Rule 60(b)(6). It is important to note that a plaintiff's right to a jury trial is not violated simply because their case is dismissed before trial, as established in the Garvie v. City of Ft. Walton Beach case. Therefore, the district court's dismissal did not infringe upon the plaintiff's Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.","No, the district court's dismissal of the plaintiff's complaint under the ""dogma"" of Ashcroft v.

"some tension among the different circuits as to the interaction between sections 107 and 113.” United States v. Hunter, 70 F.Supp.2d 1100, 1103 n. 4 (C.D.Cal.1999). For example, courts are split on the question of who may bring a CERCLA § 107 cost-recovery action, and more specifically, whether a PRP is entitled to bring a CERCLA § 107 cost-recovery action. We have held that a private PRP who incurs response costs may not bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107, and instead may only bring a claim for contribution under CERCLA § 113(f). Pinal Creek, 118 F.3d at 1301. We have not yet considered, however, whether a government PRP such as a municipality that similarly incurs response costs may bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107. Compare Hunter, 70 F.Supp.2d at 1108 (<HOLDING>), with City of Fresno, 1995 WL 641983, at **2-5",Can a government Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) such as a municipality bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107 if they incur response costs?,"The question pertains to the ability of a government PRP, specifically a municipality, to bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107 if they incur response costs. The courts have addressed the issue of who may bring a CERCLA § 107 cost-recovery action and there is a split among different circuits. In the case of private PRPs, it has been established that they cannot bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107, but instead, they can only seek contribution under CERCLA § 113(f). However, the specific scenario involving a government PRP, such as a municipality, has not been directly considered by the courts. There is conflicting case law on this matter, with some courts allowing government PRPs to bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107, while others have held otherwise. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether a government PRP, like a municipality, can bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107 based on the incurrence of response costs.","The ability of a government PRP, such as a municipality, to bring a cost-recovery action under CERCLA § 107 if they incur response costs is uncertain and subject to conflicting case law.

Givens, 88 F.3d 608, 613 (8th Cir.1996). In reviewing a trial court’s exercise of discretion and in determining whether the mistrial was manifestly necessary, one thing we consider is whether the court adequately assessed less drastic alternatives.

We also look to see whether the court gave",Are there any specific guidelines established by the United States Supreme Court regarding what constitutes manifest necessity in determining a mistrial?,"The question pertains to whether the United States Supreme Court has provided clear-cut guidelines for determining when a mistrial is necessary based on manifest necessity.

In a number of states, such exemptions have been denied based on this criterion. Alcoser v. County of San Diego, for instance, denied an exemption to a construction trade school as it did not provide traditional education and primarily benefited a particular occupation. Similarly, Gymnastics & Performing Arts Educ. Found., Inc. v. City of Rutland denied an exemption to a nonprofit school that provided gymnastics and performing arts education, considering it offered an essentially private benefit to a limited group.

Guebara, 15 Fed.Appx. 584, 589 (10th Cir.2001) (reviewing issue that was not raised at bond revocation proceedings for plain error). Under plain-error review, in the light of the lack of authority in this, or any other, circuit regarding whether the rebuttable presumption is limited only to cases whose facts involve actual minor victims (again, Emmons’ conduct involved undercover agents), the district court could not have plainly erred in applying the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention pursuant to § 3142(e). See United States v. Hull, 160 F.3d 265, 272 (5th Cir.1998) (<HOLDING>). As discussed, Emmons’ alternative contention","Is the district court's application of the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention pursuant to § 3142(e) considered plain error, even if the facts of the case do not involve actual minor victims?","The issue at hand is whether the district court's application of the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention pursuant to § 3142(e) can be considered plain error. The lack of authority in this circuit or any other regarding whether the rebuttable presumption is limited to cases with actual minor victims makes it difficult to determine if the district court plainly erred in applying the presumption in this case where Emmons' conduct only involved undercover agents. Under plain-error review, the court would consider whether the district court's decision was clear and obvious error that affected substantial rights. In this case, given the lack of clarity regarding the application of the presumption, it cannot be concluded that the district court plainly erred in applying it. This reasoning is supported by the precedent set in United States v. Hull, where the Fifth Circuit held that the district court's application of the rebuttable presumption was not plain error. Therefore, it can be concluded that the district court's application of the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention pursuant to § 3142(e) is not considered plain error.","No, the district court's application of the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention pursuant to § 3142(e) is not considered plain error, even if the facts of the case do not involve actual minor victims, as seen in the case of United States v.

"communications were similar. Each communicated its desires and opinions to a governmental entity with regulatory authority to take action affecting the property. Like SARA in relation to San Antonio, the TWDB made its opinion known to the Corps but had no authority to take the action affecting the owner’s property rights. SARA further sought a cooperation agreement between it and San Antonio. As Westgate’s focus on direct action implies, causation is an issue to be considered by Courts in takings cases. This is not the first time courts have addressed causation in a takings action. In 1941, we held that the “true test” is whether the State’s intentional acts “were the proximate cause of the taking or damaging of such property.” State v. Hale, 136 Tex. 29, 146 S.W.2d 731, 737 (1941) (<HOLDING>); see Roberson v.

In previous court cases, such as State v. Hale and Roberson v. City of Austin, the issue of causation was addressed. The court in State v. Hale established that the ""true test"" for determining a taking or damaging of property is whether the State's intentional acts were the proximate cause of such action. This means that the court considers whether the actions of the government directly led to the taking or damaging of the property. The Roberson v. City of Austin case further supports this reasoning. Therefore, based on these previous court decisions, causation can be considered in takings cases.","Yes, causation can be considered in takings cases as determined in previous court decisions such as State v.

The court ruled that it is the clerk's responsibility to independently verify the absence of any impediment to marriage, and they cannot simply accept the applicant's statement without conducting any further investigation.

Relying on the context of § 903, the",Can a bankruptcy court interfere with the spending priorities set by political authorities in the context of municipal insolvency?,"The question concerns the power of a bankruptcy court to interfere with the spending priorities of political authorities in cases of municipal insolvency. Section 903 of the applicable law establishes that the remedies provided in Chapter 9 of the law do not modify the ordinary powers that states possess over their municipalities. This provision, together with Section 904, preserves the doctrines of federal common law that previously governed municipal insolvency and upholds the constitutional principle against federal interference in state and local governance. As a result, the bankruptcy court is prohibited from restraining political authorities in setting their own spending priorities. The City of East St. Louis v. United States case further supports this interpretation by affirming the principle that federal interference in municipal affairs is not allowed.","No, a bankruptcy court cannot interfere with the spending priorities set by political authorities in the context of municipal insolvency, as outlined in Section 903 of the law and affirmed in the City of East St. Louis v. United States case."

However, during the trial, Long contradicted himself by stating that he was not aware until 2005 that he hadn't paid his taxes and believed his accountant was handling it. Additionally, he mentioned that he thought the taxes were being paid from the proceeds of the sale of his McDonald's franchise. This inconsistency suggests that Long's failure to pay taxes may have been a result of a misunderstanding with his accountant rather than deliberate intention. Therefore, it is essential to determine whether Long intentionally failed to pay taxes or if there was a miscommunication with his accountant.","It is necessary to determine whether Long intentionally failed to pay his taxes or if there was a miscommunication with his accountant, as his inconsistent testimonies during the trial suggest a possible misunderstanding regarding the responsibility for paying taxes."

"the problems here in Wash-ington D.C., in New York, in Detroit where I grew up, can be traced right back to [drug trafficking].” In Defendants’ view, the prosecutor perceived the jury “might be [uninterested in Colombia’s drug problems,” Defendants Br. 48, which led him to improperly tie the Colombian drug trade to the American drug problem, inviting the jury to act as the “community conscience.” To be sure, a suggestion that the jury act as the “community conscience” can constitute error. In United States v.

This warning indicates that it is improper to evoke juror emotions or appeal to their sense of responsibility in addressing broader societal issues.

The case of Bosack further supports this, where it was considered whether commissions earned pre-petition were exempt under § 8127(a). The debtor in that case elected to take the exemptions available under § 522(b)(3), which were essentially Pennsylvania state exemptions.

The court in Dague v. City of Burlington established that an adjustment to the lodestar is necessary if it is shown that such adjustment is necessary to determine a reasonable fee. The dissent argues that the unavailability of willing local counsel is not a proper factor justifying an enhancement of the lodestar. However, the court disagrees with the dissent and states that such an enhancement is necessary when the case is of the type that attorneys are unwilling to take due to fear of ostracization and concern for personal safety. This consideration is not reflected in the lodestar calculation and thus justifies an enhancement. The Stewart case supports this reasoning.","The unavailability of willing local counsel is considered a factor for enhancing the lodestar in determining a reasonable fee because it reflects the unique circumstances of the case where attorneys are unwilling to take it, fearing ostracization and personal safety concerns. This consideration, not accounted for in the lodestar, justifies an adjustment to ensure a reasonable fee, as established in Dague v. City of Burlington and supported by the Stewart case."

Despite ""The Ides of March"" consisting of four separate elements, if these elements come together to form an integrated whole and are considered a single work of art, then Pavia may still be entitled to protection under VARA. In the case of Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, the court held that even if a work of art consists of multiple elements, if these elements form an integrated whole, it can be considered a single work of art. Therefore, if Pavia can demonstrate that ""The Ides of March"" is an integrated whole, he may claim VARA protection for his sculpture.","Yes, Pavia can claim protection under VARA for his sculpture ""The Ides of March"" even though it consists of multiple separate elements, as long as these elements form an integrated whole, as established in the case of Carter v.

According to the Texas Business & Commerce Code, a lease of mineral rights for longer than one year must be in writing to comply with the statute of frauds. This requirement is based on the fact that mineral interests are treated as real property interests, and thus, subject to the rules relating to real property. The case of Hill v.

Regardless of whether the testimony is given during a deposition or in open court, if it is offered in the context of a judicial or administrative proceeding alleging government misconduct, it independently exposes potential government wrongdoing and can have an impact on the result of the litigation. The court argued that the public has a lesser First Amendment interest in accessing pretrial discovery materials, acknowledging that the private nature of deposition testimony can be a factor. However, in cases involving allegations of government misconduct, the importance of exposing the truth and holding the government accountable outweighs any potential concerns about public access to the deposition testimony.","The distinction between deposition testimony and testimony in open court does not matter in the context of a judicial or administrative proceeding alleging government misconduct because both types of testimonies independently expose potential government wrongdoing and can impact the result of the litigation.

The court in Dickson v. Biomeasure clarified that plaintiffs must satisfy certain factors to establish jurisdiction, as outlined in the case. The Bauman case also supports this requirement.

Because so much time passed between the conviction and the sentencing, and this evidence was substantial enough that it reasonably could have altered the balance between the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, there does seem to be a reasonable probability that, but for defense counsel’s failure to reargue the favorable evidence from trial, the judge would have sentenced Pizzuto to life rather than death. Also, considered cumulatively with counsel’s other deficiencies discussed below, defense counsel’s failure to contest the State’s case in aggravation was prejudicial. See Harris v.

This failure by defense counsel gives rise to a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been presented, the judge would have sentenced the defendant to life instead of the death penalty.

I believe that the language of this provision, which includes “thirty (30) days before the primary----” as its reference point of disaffiliation, when read in context, clearly reveals that the General Assembly intended it to apply to major, not minor, political parties. This is so because in the Election Code, the legislature has determined that only major parties may gain ballot access through the primary process. See Heicklen v. Pennsylvania Board of Elections, 751 A.2d 260, 262 (Pa.Cmwlth.), aff'd per curiam, 561 Pa. 33, 747 A.2d 894 (2000)(<HOLDING>) Further, even if Camejo’s affidavit were",Can Camejo appear on the ballot as the candidate of a political body despite his membership in the Green Party?,"The question revolves around the interpretation of Section 951.1, 25 Pa.C.S. § 2911.1, which determines the eligibility of Camejo to appear on the ballot.

However, a careful examination of the language in this provision indicates that it applies to major political parties, not minor ones like the Green Party. The reference point of disaffiliation, ""thirty (30) days before the primary,"" suggests that the General Assembly intended this provision for major parties that gain ballot access through the primary process.

"Having determined that the district court’s sentencing calculations were based oh a proper interpretation of § 2F1.1(b)(1), we turn to the district court’s assessment of the amount of the intended loss. We find that the district court’s determination that Kipta intended to defraud First Chicago out of the entire $171,355.46 was not clearly erroneous. The fraudulent letter that Kipta used to back her deposits stated that she had -reserves of $800,000.00, an amount more than sufficient to cover the deposits into the First Chicago account. There was nothing to limit the amount of funds available for withdrawal, and the corresponding potential for loss by First Chicago, to less than the total amount deposited into the account.

In the context of TxDOT’s motion for summary",Can a job interviewer's statement about age concern be considered direct evidence of age discrimination in the employer's decision not to hire the plaintiff?,"The question pertains to whether a job interviewer's statement about age concern can be considered direct evidence of age discrimination in the employer's decision not to hire the plaintiff. The court in Brown v. E. Miss. Elec. Power Ass'n held that direct evidence of discrimination must establish a clear and explicit link between the alleged discriminatory animus and the adverse employment action, without requiring any inference or presumption. In Haas v. ADVO Sys., Inc., the court ruled that despite a reasonable inference that the interviewer influenced the employer's hiring preferences, an additional inference was needed to conclude that the decisionmaker himself chose not to hire the plaintiff based on age discrimination. Thus, a mere statement about age concern by a job interviewer does not constitute direct evidence of age discrimination, as an additional inference is required to establish the link between the interviewer's remarks and the final decision to not hire the plaintiff.","No, a job interviewer's statement about age concern cannot be considered direct evidence of age discrimination in the employer's decision not to hire the plaintiff.

This is evident from Appellees' argument that the State should not benefit from its own tardiness and that the statutory framework does not permit such manipulation. The court's decision in Chatha v.

"court’s jurisdiction to sit as an appellate court is very limited. For instance, the circuit court has true appellate jurisdiction to review state administrative agency determinations, see Code §§ 2.2-4026 and 17.1-513, and, arguably, a conviction of summary contempt in a district court. See Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474 (2008). However, in criminal cases, the General Assembly has not provided any authorization that would permit a circuit court to review a district court’s discretionary decision ending a prosecution. Without such an express grant, the circuit court did not have jurisdiction to determine whether the district court’s decision constituted an abuse of discretion. See, e.g., Nicely v. Commonwealth, 23 Va.App. 327, 333-34, 477 S.E.2d 11, 13 (1996) (<HOLDING>).

"in the course of mental health counseling. See id. at 561. Any threat of disclosure of such information would obstruct, if not bar, successful treatment. See McCormick § 98, at 447. Moreover, unwanted disclosure of highly personal information separately implicates one of the most fundamental tenets of all law—the right to privacy. Heemstra, 721 N.W.2d at 561. Thus, we are not just dealing with a strong belief recognized by statute, but a right with roots found in our constitution. The privilege necessarily recognizes a right to protect the privacy interests of the individual to keep private information from public disclosure, independent from the need for optimum medical treatment recognized by statute. See McMaster v. Bd. of Psychology Exam’rs, 509 N.W.2d 754, 758-59 (Iowa 1993) (<HOLDING>).

"the possibility that the appointed attorney may appear in court before the judge who appointed him.” Id. at 677 n. 14, 108 S.Ct. 2597. This history is directly relevant to our analysis. In context, the appointment of defense counsel for indigent criminal defendants would seem to be a necessary step for judges to take in order to provide for fair process. That rationale applies to the appointment of interim United States Attorneys with equal force. It is in keeping with preserving the institutional integrity of the judiciary that judges, faced with an indefinite vacancy in the office of United States Attorney, seek out a competent lawyer to represent the government. Cf. Young v. United States ex rel. Vuitton et Fils, 481 U.S. 787, 800-01, 107 S.Ct. 2124, 95 L.Ed.2d 740 (1987) (<HOLDING>).

This practice is in line with the historical context where the possibility of the appointed attorney appearing in court before the judge who appointed them was acknowledged, emphasizing the importance of impartiality and fairness in the legal system.

See Drake v. Southwestern Bell Tel. Co., 553 F.2d 1185, 1188 (8th Cir.1977) (applying Missouri five-year statute of limitations to a cause of action under § 1981). According to the trial court, the last act of harassment directed at Roddy was the kicking incident in April 1991, and the statute of limitations ran back only to March 1992. Although Roddy agrees that conduct prior to March 1992 is not actionable, Roddy contends that the record as a whole shows the existence of a pattern of harassment more recently than March 1992.

The trial court determined that the last act of harassment directed at Roddy was the kicking incident in April 1991. Since the statute of limitations only ran back to March 1992, the court concluded that the claim for harassment within the five-year limitation was not demonstrated. However, Roddy argues that the record as a whole shows a pattern of harassment occurring more recently than March 1992, relying on the decision in Van Steenburgh v. Rival Co. Therefore, it is crucial to consider whether the pattern of harassment after March 1992 is sufficient evidence to extend the statute of limitations.","The validity of Roddy's claim for harassment within the statute of limitations under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 depends on whether the pattern of harassment after March 1992, as evidenced by the record, is deemed sufficient to extend the applicable five-year limitation period established in Drake v.

It is only when there is evidence that the delay caused a change in the parent's financial condition, making enforcement of the support obligation inequitable, that the doctrine of laches may be considered. This was held in the case of Logan v. Logan, where it was established that a change in financial condition caused by the delay must be present to justify the application of laches.","No, a parent cannot be relieved from their obligation to support their child based on the doctrine of laches in Florida, unless there is extreme prejudice to the defendant and evidence of a change in the parent's financial condition caused by the delay, as stated in Logan v. Logan."
"the court acknowledged: [I]t is extraordinary for dischargeability litigation that hinges on a debtor’s medical condition to actually hinge on medical testimony. This is because all dis-chargeability litigation involves real persons who are debtors under the Bankruptcy Code, and cannot afford to hire medical experts to testify to the effect of their disease on their disease on their earning capacity. When medical testimony is offered by the debtor it is to lay skepticism to rest, and in this writer’s experience the medical condition of any debtor has never been the subject of dueling experts in § 523(a)(8) litigation. 219 B.R. 665, 669 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1998).

In this case, the court must assess whether the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits demonstrate the presence of genuine issues of material fact. When ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court is required to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. This principle, as established in Bayer v. Dep't of Treasury and Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., emphasizes that the nonmoving party must present evidence beyond conclusory allegations to create a genuine issue of material fact. Therefore, if the plaintiffs' allegations fail to provide specific and sufficient information about their interests in the territory, particularly when described as ""unspecified portions of an immense two-million-acre tract of territory,"" such vague allegations may not withstand a motion for summary judgment.","The sufficiency of the plaintiffs' allegations in this case may not withstand a motion for summary judgment.

However, in its analysis, the district court repeatedly underscored its deferential stance with regard to the magistrate judge’s order. There is simply no way to read the district court’s analysis as a product of its independent judgment. Therefore, we must vacate the district court’s order and remand.

"that eight major oil companies were violating the Federal Trade Commission Act was not final agency action. See id. at 246, 101 S.Ct. 488. The Court reasoned that the FTC’s averment of “reason to believe” 'that the oil companies were violating the FTCA was “not a definitive statement of position [but instead] represented] a threshold determination that further inquiry [was] warranted and that a complaint should initiate proceedings.” Id. at 241, 101 S.Ct. 488.

Therefore, the possibility of future review by the court of last resort, in this case, the United States Supreme Court, could provide justification for the Superior Court to consider the habeas corpus petition on its merits. This means that even if the issues have been previously addressed in appeals before the creation of the court of last resort, the Superior Court may still have the authority to review the petition if there is a chance for future review by the highest court.","Yes, the Superior Court can consider a habeas corpus petition on its merits, even if the Appellate Division and Third Circuit have already addressed the issues raised in the petition, as long as there is a possibility of future review by the court of last resort, such as the United States Supreme Court.

Shoney’s Enterprises, Inc., 640 S.W.2d at 507-08. However, the facts and circumstances in a particular case may be so one-sided that the trial court can say, as a matter of law, that a dangerous condition was so open and obvious that the plaintiff knew or should have known of the danger and assumed the risk. See, e.g., Harris v. Niehaus, 857 S.W.2d at 226-27 (<HOLDING>); Hokanson v.

According to the doctrine of imputed knowledge, an employee's actual knowledge is imputed to the employer. Therefore, Hardee's can be held responsible for the dangerous condition because the employee's knowledge is imputable to them. Furthermore, even if Hardee's did not have actual knowledge of the dangerous condition, they could still be deemed to have constructive knowledge. This is supported by cases such as Par v. Hardee's and Turcol v. Shoney's Enterprises, Inc., which establish that constructive knowledge can be attributed to the premises owner based on the circumstances. However, there are situations where the open and obvious nature of a dangerous condition may be so apparent that the plaintiff is deemed to have assumed the risk. In such cases, the trial court, as a matter of law, can determine that the plaintiff should have known about the danger and thus assumed the risk. Harris v. Niehaus and Hokanson v. Joplin Rendering Co. are examples of cases where the court made such a determination.","Yes, Hardee's can be held liable for the dangerous condition on their premises, even if the employee had actual knowledge of the danger. The doctrine of imputed knowledge attributes the employee's knowledge to Hardee's, making them responsible for the dangerous condition.

"Court appreciates that there is a declining market for the PRRS vaccine which may limit the duration of Boehringer’s patent. Moreover, Schering has informed the Court that Bayer Corporation and other companies now market competing vaccines which will also affect the PRRS market.

These limitations on the commercial success of Boehringer’s patent and the effective duration of its patent, even if not caused by Schering’s conduct, is an indication that Boehringer’s Patent has a shortened duration and thus, Boehringer’s need to enforce its right to exclusivity is more acute at this time.

"stating that “[an] argument that the trial judge exceeded his discretion by enjoining the appellants beyond the time specified in the ... contract is without merit”). We agree with Guy Carpenter. The expiration of the one-year contract limit does not make this issue moot.

Exercising this equitable power might be particularly appropriate given the district court’s year-long delay before ruling on the motion to reconsider.

In this case, the district court's considerable delay before ruling on the motion to reconsider could be a relevant factor for extending the injunction. It is important to note that the cases cited by Provenzale in support of his mootness argument, namely Hi-Line Electric Co. v. Dowco Electrical Products and John R. Ray & Sons, Inc. v. Stroman, are not applicable to the specific circumstances of this case.","Yes, under Texas law, the district court has the power to issue an injunction that extends beyond the expiration of a non-solicitation covenant, especially considering the equitable power it possesses and the significant delay in ruling on the motion to reconsider. The cases cited by Provenzale do not apply in this context."

The text explicitly states that acts in violation of this section constitute only simple assault.

Neither of the FDIC’s other arguments undermines this conclusion. First, the court is unpersuaded by the FDIC’s claim that a broad interpretation of the arbitration clause would render the forum selection clause superfluous.

The latter claim is the based upon the Rolands’ belief that General Motors should have warned that the lap belt was only properly used with a conventional child car seat.

The fact that Van Allen may have deceived Archer Bank is also immaterial to the substantive violation under 31 U.S.C. § 5324(a). This is supported by the precedent set in Cassano, 372 F.3d at 878, where the court established this principle.","No, the fact that Archer Bank filed Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs) does not have any relevance to determining Van Allen's guilt or innocence as per the Federal Rules of Evidence and the precedent set in Cassano, 372 F.3d."
"Justice. The petition for the writ of certiorari is denied.

In this particular case, the denial of the petition can be understood in light of the Ex parte Bonner case, where a similar denial of the petition for the writ of certiorari was made. This indicates that the Supreme Court is upholding the decision made by the lower court and is not willing to review or overturn it. The Ex parte V.S. case also supports this understanding. Therefore, the denial of the petition essentially means that the lower court's ruling stands and is final.","The denial of the petition for the writ of certiorari in this case signifies that the Supreme Court has chosen not to review the lower court's decision.

"given effect. These cases allow for each employee or retiree individually to decide whether to consent to arbitration of his or her own claims. Pryner further indicates that where the employee/retiree and employer/former employer agree to arbitration, “there is nothing to prevent a binding arbitration.” Id.; see also Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., 474 F.3d at 283 (finding “there is no real danger that Cooper would have to relitigate the same issues with individual retirees that will have already been arbitrated with the Union”); IDS Life Ins.

The case of Pryner establishes that both the employee/retiree and the employer/former employer must agree to arbitration for it to be binding. It further states that in cases where both parties agree, binding arbitration can take place. This aligns with the decision in Cooper Tire & Rubber Co., which found that if the issues have already been arbitrated with the union, there is no real danger of having to relitigate the same issues with individual retirees. Additionally, the IDS Life Ins. Co. case states that disputes resolved by arbitrators are closed to further litigation by res judicata and collateral estoppel. However, the Meza v. Gen.

"the circumstantial evidence was not inconsistent with a passenger having placed the gun on the seat when they fled. See 724 So.2d at 1215. See also Bailey v. State, 442 So.2d 385 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983). In Daniels v. State, 718 So.2d 1274 (Fla. 2d DCA 1998), the defendant was driving a car when it was stopped by police. While the defendant was being handcuffed, a passenger was alone in the car. Police subsequently found a gun in the car that was not readily visible. This court reversed the defendant’s conviction for felon in possession of a firearm, holding that the State did not show that the defendant had actual knowledge of the gun or other circumstances from which the jury could possibly infer knowledge. See 718 So.2d at 1275. See also Green v. State, 586 So.2d 86 (Fla. 2d DCA 1991) (<HOLDING>). In the present case, there was no evidence","Is the presence of a gun in a car sufficient evidence to convict someone of possession of a firearm, even if they claim they were not aware of its presence?","The question pertains to whether the presence of a gun in a car is enough evidence to establish possession of a firearm. In the case of Daniels v. State, it was established that the State must show that the defendant had actual knowledge of the gun or other circumstances from which the jury could infer knowledge in order to convict them of felon in possession of a firearm. This ruling was based on the fact that the defendant was driving the car when it was stopped by the police, and a gun was subsequently found in the car that was not readily visible. The court found that the State failed to provide sufficient evidence to prove the defendant's knowledge of the gun. Similarly, in Green v. State, it was held that the presence of a gun alone is not enough to support a conviction without additional evidence. Therefore, in the present case, if there is no evidence establishing the defendant's knowledge of the gun found in the car, it may not be sufficient to convict them of possession of a firearm.","No, the presence of a gun in a car alone is not sufficient evidence to convict someone of possession of a firearm if there is no additional evidence establishing their knowledge of the gun, as established in Daniels v. State and Green v. State."
"that, because Mr. Grant refused to allow a search of his house, he knew that he could refuse consent for a search of his property. Of course, the deputies had already searched the property, thus demonstrating to Mr. Grant that they had an absolute right to search and that his “consent” to any further search was a mere formality which he could not refuse. See Gonzalez v. State, 578 So.2d 729, 733-34 (Fla. 3d DCA 1991). Under the circumstances before us, Mr. Grant could only conclude that refusing consent would be “a futile gesture amounting to no more than ‘closing the barn door after the horse is out.’ ” United States v.

Such agreements may be justified by the employer’s need to protect itself from unfair competition by former employees. See BDO Seidman v.

Plaintiffs introduced no evidence to support the proposition that a covenant restricting competition of the kind at issue in this case, anywhere in the world, is reasonable in terms of scope; nor have Plaintiffs pointed to any cases in this jurisdiction that would support the Court drawing such a conclusion. Indeed, the case law suggests just the opposite. See, e.g., Silipos, Inc. v. Bickel, No. 06 Civ. 2205(RCC), 2006 WL 2265055, at *6 (S.D.N.Y.2006) (<HOLDING>); Heartland Sec. Corp. v.

In this case, the plaintiffs have failed to present any evidence supporting the reasonableness of a covenant restricting competition worldwide. Furthermore, there are no cases in this jurisdiction that would support the conclusion that such a global restriction is reasonable. The case law, such as Silipos, Inc. v. Bickel and Heartland Sec.

We conclude that the legislature has deliberately removed the statutory right of judgment creditors to compel a non-judgment debtor third party to testify at a supplemental proceeding.

The relevant law in Wisconsin is Wis. Stat. § 273.06 (1935) and § 816.06 (2007-08). Analysis of the legislative history reveals that the language in the amended statutes is identical, indicating that since 1935, the supplemental proceeding law in Wisconsin has not granted the right to judgment creditors to compel a non-judgment debtor third party to testify. This deliberate removal of such a statutory right is evident, and courts generally cannot find a statutory right based solely on legislative silence. Therefore, the judgment creditor does not have the authority to compel a non-judgment debtor third party to testify at a supplemental proceeding in Wisconsin.","No, a judgment creditor cannot compel a non-judgment debtor third party to testify at a supplemental proceeding in Wisconsin, as demonstrated by the deliberate removal of such a statutory right since 1935."
"As previously noted, the parties dispute when Tri-Etch alerted Cincinnati of Young’s death and the resulting lawsuit. Cincinnati asks us to find Tri-Etch’s notice unreasonably late as a matter of law and affirm the trial court’s summary judgment order on this basis. However, regardless of when Cincinnati received notice of Young’s death and the Estate’s lawsuit, Cincinnati has always contended that Young’s death was not an “occurrence” entitled to coverage under its policies.

The Supreme Court in Miller v.

Therefore, considering the precedents set by Clay, Kotteakos, Cole, and Craddock, it can be stated that the prior perjury conviction and acknowledgment of guilt did not have a strong impact on the fact finder's decision.","No, the prior perjury conviction and acknowledgment of guilt for that offense did not significantly influence the fact finder's decision, as determined by the Clay v. Commonwealth case and the principles set forth in Kotteakos, Cole, and Craddock."
"for a sweep that requires information to justify it in the first place”). {15} Our review of the testimony at the suppression hearing indicates an absence of any facts suggesting the presence of, much less any danger posed by, other persons on the scene. Burrell admitted he had no facts to suggest that anyone else was in the house, and he admitted that he neither saw nor heard any movement in the house. To the extent other agents conducted surveillance of the residence before Burrell arrived, they also failed to detect the presence of any other persons. We therefore conclude that the search was unwarranted because there was no evidence to support any specific safety concerns involving any other persons at the arrest scene. See United States v. Chaves, 169 F.3d 687, 692 (11th Cir. 1999) (<HOLDING>). {16} The State contends that other courts",Can the search conducted by Agent Burrell be considered unwarranted due to the absence of evidence suggesting the presence of other persons at the arrest scene?,"The question revolves around the justification of the search conducted by Agent Burrell. Based on the testimony at the suppression hearing, there were no facts indicating the presence of other individuals at the scene. Agent Burrell himself admitted that he did not have any information or witness any movement in the house that would suggest the presence of other persons. Additionally, other agents who conducted surveillance prior to Burrell's arrival also failed to detect the presence of anyone else. As established in the United States v. Chaves case, a search can be considered unwarranted if there is no evidence supporting specific safety concerns involving other individuals. Therefore, in this case, the search conducted by Agent Burrell can indeed be considered unwarranted due to the absence of evidence suggesting the presence of other persons at the arrest scene.","Yes, the search conducted by Agent Burrell can be considered unwarranted due to the absence of evidence suggesting the presence of other persons at the arrest scene, as established in the United States v.

"that SEIU has abandoned this claim. Additionally, the preliminary injunction was issued by the district court pursuant to section 301(a). Thus, our resolution of the jurisdictional issue has relevance to the ongoing litigation. Moreover, and essential to our determination here, in the preliminary injunction the district court explicitly preserved a portion of the TRO as still effective after issuance of the injunction. The preliminary injunction states, “all defendants in this action remain subject to paragraph three of the TRO and subsequent orders regarding the imaging of electronic devices.” (Order Granting In Part Mot. For Prelim. Inj. at 17). Thus it seems the TRO has not expired and remains enforceable. Compare Am. Tunaboat Ass’n v. Brown, 67 F.3d 1404, 1407 (9th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>), with Negrete, 523 F.3d at 1098 (holding",Is the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) still enforceable after the issuance of the preliminary injunction?,"The question revolves around the enforceability of the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) after the issuance of the preliminary injunction. According to the wording of the preliminary injunction issued by the district court, a portion of the TRO was explicitly preserved and deemed still effective. Specifically, paragraph three of the TRO pertaining to the imaging of electronic devices remains enforceable. This preservation of the TRO in the preliminary injunction suggests that it has not expired and retains its enforceability. A comparison can be drawn to the case of Am. Tunaboat Ass'n v. Brown, where a similar situation led to the conclusion that the TRO remained in effect even after the preliminary injunction was issued. This contrasts with the holding in the Negrete case, which presented a different outcome. Based on the explicit preservation of the TRO in the preliminary injunction, it can be inferred that the TRO in question is still enforceable.","Yes, the Temporary Restraining Order (TRO) remains enforceable after the issuance of the preliminary injunction, as indicated by the explicit preservation of a portion of the TRO in the preliminary injunction and supported by the precedent set in the Am. Tunaboat Ass'n v. Brown case."

The statute requires an alien to prove good moral character to be eligible for cancellation of removal. However, the Immigration Act prohibits an alien who has been confined as a result of conviction from establishing good moral character. This statutory provision applies to decisions regarding eligibility for relief under 8 U.S.C. § 1255 as well. Succar v. Ashcroft and Pilica v. Ashcroft are two relevant cases that have held the ineligibility of an alien who has been confined due to a conviction from establishing good moral character. Therefore, an alien who has been convicted of a crime and confined as a result of that conviction would not be able to establish good moral character for the purpose of cancellation of removal.","No, an alien who has been convicted of a crime and confined as a result of that conviction cannot establish good moral character for the purpose of cancellation of removal, as per the Immigration Act and the legal precedents set by Succar v.

"by our procedural rules. In the forty years since those decisions, Texas courts have consistently recognized and reaffirmed the existence of the fundamental-error doctrine. Because there is no statute defining the principle, we tend to agree with the commentator who noted that “[tjhere is no single satisfactory definition of the phrase, nor can one easily analyze the cases for prognostic purposes.” Kronzer, supra, § 9.2, at 205. In reviewing our caselaw, however, we are able to distill two types of error that our courts have consistently recognized are subject to fundamental-error review. First, and most commonly, we apply fundamental-error review when a jurisdictional defect exists in the case. See, e.g., Texas Ass’n of Bus. v.

"the named driver exclusion is placed at the end of the policy rather than in the UM/UIM coverage part. But the placement of the exclusion after the “general provisions” of the policy is entirely consistent with an interpretation of the exclusion as applying to “any claim,” regardless of the specific coverage under which the claimant seeks to recover. If, in fact, the exclusion applies only to the liability coverage, as plaintiffs contend, it is more logical that the exclusion would have been placed in the policy part for “liability to others.” We do not think the location of the exclusion supports an interpretation limiting the exclusion to the liability coverage. See Rockford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Econ. Fire & Cas. Co., 217 Ill.App.3d 181, 160 Ill.Dec. 187, 576 N.E.2d 1141, 1144-45 (1991) (<HOLDING>).

In this case, the exclusion is placed at the end of the policy after the ""general provisions."" This positioning supports the interpretation that the exclusion applies to ""any claim,"" regardless of the specific coverage under which the claimant seeks to recover. If the exclusion only applied to the liability coverage, it would have been more logical to place it in the policy section specifically addressing ""liability to others."" The court in Rockford Mut. Ins. Co. v. Econ. Fire & Cas. Co. also supported this reasoning by holding that the location of the exclusion does not limit it to liability coverage. Therefore, the placement of the named driver exclusion at the end of the policy suggests it applies broadly to all claims, reinforcing its applicability beyond just liability coverage.","The placement of the named driver exclusion at the end of the insurance policy is significant as it indicates that the exclusion applies to ""any claim,"" regardless of the specific coverage sought.

The case of Saenz v. State held that subsections (A) and (B) of Section 19.03(a)(7) should be interpreted disjunctively.

"[the father] to [the mother] in the sum of $2,730.00.” The trial court further ordered the father to pay the attorney for the mother the sum of $2,789.08 within 180 days for the fees incurred in the action. The father filed a timely postjudgment motion, which the trial court granted in part and denied in part. The father timely appealed to this court. The father first argues that the trial court erred in awarding the mother “living expense assistance.” The father contends that Alabama law does not recognize such an award, except for periodic alimony, which, he says, the mother did not request and could not recover. The father further notes that the mother petitioned only for postminority support for their adult disabled daughter, see Ex parte Brewington, 445 So.2d 294, 297 (Ala.1983) (<HOLDING>), which, he says, can be awarded only in","Does Alabama law recognize the award of ""living expense assistance"" in divorce cases?","The question at hand pertains to the recognition of ""living expense assistance"" in divorce cases under Alabama law.

He also highlights that the mother solely appealed for postminority support for their adult disabled daughter, based on the precedent set by Ex parte Brewington. It is evident that ""living expense assistance"" is not typically acknowledged under Alabama law unless it aligns with the concept of periodic alimony. Therefore, the trial court's decision to award ""living expense assistance"" may require further examination for its legal validity.","The recognition of ""living expense assistance"" as an award in divorce cases in Alabama is questionable, as it is not explicitly recognized under Alabama law, unless it is in the form of periodic alimony.

"was acting to obtain a benefit on behalf of a charitable ... organization.” U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 cmt. 8(B). As the district court saw it and as the government sees it, Webster deserves the enhancement.

As Webster sees it, the enhancement does not apply. In his view, the commentary limits the application of the charity enhancement, and he was not acting to obtain a benefit on behalf of a charitable organization (as the commentary seems to require). As a general matter, the text of a guideline trumps commentary about it. See Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (<HOLDING>).

However, Webster argues that the enhancement does not apply to him as the commentary of U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 suggests that the benefit should be obtained on behalf of a charitable organization, which he claims he was not doing. While guidelines' commentary can provide guidance, the text of the guideline itself takes precedence over the commentary. As established in Stinson v. United States, the text of a guideline supersedes any commentary discussing it. Hence, whether or not the charity enhancement is applicable to Webster must also be determined based on the guideline's text.","Webster may argue against the application of the enhancement for acting on behalf of a charitable organization under U.S.S.G. § 2B1.1 b(9)(A) if he can demonstrate that he was not obtaining a benefit on behalf of a charitable organization, as stated in the guideline's text, despite the government's assertion and the district court's view.

"the period required to replace it. Damages in Tort, supra § 37.54[1], at 166—67; McCormick, supra § 124. The general rule regarding damages occasioned by the total destruction of one’s motor vehicle has long been limited to recovery simply for the vehicle’s value at the time of destruction. The reason for this rule is not clear. It may be based upon the historical limitation contained in an action for trover at common law; or because plaintiff has the presumed ability to enter the marketplace with the sum awarded and purchase another product; or perhaps upon the theory that in recovering the full value of the vehicle as of the date of destruction, the owner has been made whole. Allanson v. Cummings, 81 A.D.2d 16, 439 N.Y.S.2d 545, 546-47 (1981) (citations and internal quotat 1962) (<HOLDING>). The rationale supporting this proposition is",Why is the general rule regarding damages for total destruction of a motor vehicle limited to recovery for the vehicle's value at the time of destruction?,"The question pertains to the limitation placed on damages in cases involving the total destruction of a motor vehicle. The general rule dictates that the owner can only recover the value of the vehicle at the time of its destruction. The reason for this rule is not entirely clear and may be rooted in several theories. One possibility is that it stems from the historical limitations of an action for trover at common law. Another theory suggests that the owner is presumed to have the ability to enter the marketplace and purchase a replacement vehicle using the awarded sum. Additionally, it may be based on the notion that by recovering the full value of the vehicle at the time of destruction, the owner is considered to be made whole. The Allanson v. Cummings case supports this proposition.","The general rule limits the damages for the total destruction of a motor vehicle to the vehicle's value at the time of destruction.

"argument, however, ignores two important limitations to the shield: (1) the shield is removed if the individual’s personal interests motivate his actions, see Rice, 38 F.3d at 912; and (2) the shield generally does not apply when the individual’s actions are discretionary.

This means that if an individual is acting to serve their own personal interests, such as dislike or malice towards the plaintiff, the fiduciary shield protection will not apply. Therefore, if an individual's personal interests are found to be the driving force behind their actions, the shield may be removed.","Yes, the fiduciary shield protection can be removed if an individual's personal interests motivate their actions, as established in the Rice case."
"incident — reflecting conduct that is not pervasive or frequent — may be sufficiently severe to constitute sexual harassment, it must be “extremely serious” in order to “amount to discriminatory changes in the ‘terms and conditions of employment.’ ” Id. (quoting Faragher, 524 U.S. at 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275). As this court recently noted, “[t]he determination of whether alleged conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive is not an exact science, but this [cjourt’s decisions on this issue provide guidance.” Gibson v. Potter, 264 Fed.Appx. 397, 400 (5th Cir.2008). The type of non-consensual physical touching alleged by Paul was held to be actionable under Title VII only in cases where it was chronic and frequent. See McKinnis v. Crescent Guardian, Inc., 189 Fed.Appx. 307, 310 (5th Cir.2006) (<HOLDING>); Harvill, 433 F.3d at 435-36 (holding that",Can a single incident of non-consensual physical touching be considered severe enough to constitute sexual harassment and result in discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment?,"The question pertains to whether a single incident of non-consensual physical touching can be classified as severe enough to constitute sexual harassment and bring about discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment. As established in Gibson v. Potter, the determination of whether alleged conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive is not an exact science, but previous court decisions provide guidance. While a single incident may be considered sexual harassment, it must be ""extremely serious"" to amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment, as indicated in Faragher. Specifically, non-consensual physical touching, like the one alleged by Paul, has been deemed actionable under Title VII only in cases where it is chronic and frequent, as seen in McKinnis v. Crescent Guardian, Inc. Therefore, for a single incident to have legal implications, it would need to be severe and involve chronic and frequent behavior of a similar nature.","A single incident of non-consensual physical touching is typically not enough to constitute sexual harassment and bring about discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment. However, based on previous court decisions such as McKinnis v. Crescent Guardian, Inc., chronic and frequent non-consensual physical touching has been deemed actionable under Title VII."
"Taylor argues that: (1) his conviction was unconstitutional, under the Commerce Clause, because § 922(g)(1) does not regulate an activity with a sufficient nexus to interstate commerce; and (2) he was sentenced in violation of United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), because the district court enhanced his sentence based upon facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by him, pursuant to a mandatory sentencing scheme. We review the constitutionality of statutes de novo. United States v. Scott, 263 F.3d 1270, 1271 (11th Cir.2001). Taylor preserved his Booker error by objecting, based on Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), at sentencing. See United States v. Mathenia, 409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, he is entitled to preserved",Did Taylor's conviction violate the Commerce Clause and was his sentencing in violation of United States v. Booker?,"The question involves two arguments made by Taylor. Firstly, he argues that his conviction was unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause because the statute he was convicted under, § 922(g)(1), does not regulate an activity connected enough to interstate commerce. Secondly, he claims that his sentencing violated United States v. Booker because the district court used facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by him to enhance his sentence, under a mandatory sentencing system. In reviewing the constitutionality of statutes, the court applies a de novo standard. It is important to note that Taylor's objection at sentencing, based on Blakely v. Washington, preserved his Booker error. Therefore, he is entitled to a preserved error analysis.","Yes, there are two arguments presented by Taylor. Firstly, he argues that his conviction violated the Commerce Clause. Secondly, he claims that his sentencing violated United States v. Booker. The constitutionality of statutes is subject to a de novo review, and Taylor has preserved his Booker error by objecting at sentencing, based on Blakely v. Washington."
"Loschiavo for the proposition that § 1983 could be used to enforce regulations “which have the force of law”). The current Sixth Circuit precedent treats regulations as “laws” under § 1983 and looks to determine whether the regulation at issue creates rights. In essence, regulations are treated in the same manner as statutes for purposes of determining whether they create new enforceable rights under § 1983. A such, district courts in the Sixth Circuit must determine, just as with federal statutes, whether federal regulations presented by § 1983 plaintiffs create enforceable rights. This court questions whether the Sixth Circuit’s rule can be correct in light of the Supreme Court’s decisions in Alexander v. Sandoval and Gonzaga University v. Doe. See Save Our Valley, 335 F.3d at 937 (<HOLDING>). These two decisions, when read together,","Can federal regulations be treated as ""laws"" under Section 1983 for the purpose of determining whether they create enforceable rights?","The question pertains to whether federal regulations can be considered as ""laws"" under Section 1983 and whether they create enforceable rights. The Sixth Circuit precedent, in cases such as Loschiavo, has treated regulations as ""laws"" and has looked at whether they create rights. This means that regulations are viewed in the same way as statutes when determining if they establish new enforceable rights under Section 1983. However, this court has doubts about the correctness of the Sixth Circuit's rule in light of the Supreme Court's decisions in Alexander v. Sandoval and Gonzaga University v. Doe. These Supreme Court decisions, when considered together, may impact the treatment of regulations as ""laws"" and their ability to create enforceable rights under Section 1983.","The treatment of federal regulations as ""laws"" and their ability to create enforceable rights under Section 1983 is a matter of interpretation. While the current Sixth Circuit precedent considers regulations as ""laws"" and assesses whether they establish rights, there may be doubt regarding the correctness of this rule based on Supreme Court decisions such as Alexander v. Sandoval and Gonzaga University v. Doe. Further examination of these Supreme Court decisions is necessary to determine the status of federal regulations under Section 1983."
"is a tool the jury may utilize to gauge the defendant’s intent and is helpful in situations in which the defendant’s intent to deceive may be unclear. For example, if the defendant asserts that he was merely joking, that the statements were mere puffery, or that the statements were merely sharp business dealing, evidence that the statements would have deceived a person of ordinary prudence and comprehension is evidence that defendant actually intended to deceive. United States v. Coffman, 94 F.3d 330, 333-34 (7th Cir.1996) (Posner, J.) (rejecting “unreasonable victim argument”; the ordinary prudence standard helps the jury determine if defendant had fraudulent intent and helps distinguish between sharp dealing and fraud). Thus, the ordinary pruden r, 609 F.2d 126, 132 (5th Cir.1980) (<HOLDING>); Linden v. United States, 254 F.2d 560, 567-68",Can evidence that the defendant's statements would have deceived a person of ordinary prudence and comprehension be used to determine the defendant's intent to deceive?,"The question pertains to the use of evidence to determine the defendant's intent to deceive. In the case of United States v. Coffman, the court established that evidence that the defendant's statements would have deceived a person of ordinary prudence and comprehension can be used as evidence of the defendant's actual intent to deceive. This is particularly relevant when the defendant claims that the statements were mere puffery, jokes, or sharp business dealing. By establishing that the statements would have deceived an ordinary person, it helps the jury distinguish between legitimate business practices and fraudulent intent. The cases of United States v. Penny and Linden v. United States also support this line of reasoning.","Yes, evidence that the defendant's statements would have deceived a person of ordinary prudence and comprehension can be utilized to determine the defendant's intent to deceive, as established in the United States v. Coffman, United States v. Penny, and Linden v. United States cases."
"of, or immediately after, the return of the verdict.” Azimi v. Jordan’s Meats, Inc., 456 F.3d 228, 240 (1st Cir.2006) (emphasis added). The Azimi court noted that this rule allows a plaintiff to avoid the tactical dilemma that occurs when a plaintiff is forced to choose between asking for only compensatory damages and risking a zero-dollar verdict, on one hand, or requesting a nominal damages instruction and giving the jury an easy “out” on the other hand. Id. Miller argues that this is the dilemma he faced. Before addressing the tactical dilemma issue, it must first be noted that, although .the First Circuit has adopted an exception to Rule 51(c)(2), many circuits that have addressed similar issues have declined to do so. See Oliver v. Falla, 258 F.3d 1277, 1282 (11th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>); Piaubert v. MacIntosh, 10 Fed.Appx. 503 (9th","In a civil case, can a plaintiff request a nominal damages instruction to avoid the tactical dilemma of choosing between compensatory damages and risking a zero-dollar verdict?","The question pertains to the issue of whether a plaintiff can request a nominal damages instruction to navigate the tactical dilemma in a civil case. The Azimi v. Jordan's Meats, Inc. case established that a plaintiff is allowed to request a nominal damages instruction to avoid the tactical dilemma of choosing between compensatory damages and risking a zero-dollar verdict. This rule acknowledges that when a plaintiff is forced to choose between these options, it can put them in a disadvantageous position. By requesting a nominal damages instruction, the plaintiff can provide the jury with an alternative decision that prevents them from completely absolving the defendant. It is important to note that while the First Circuit has adopted this exception to Rule 51(c)(2), other circuits have chosen not to do so, as seen in the Oliver v. Falla and Piaubert v. MacIntosh cases.","Yes, in a civil case, a plaintiff can request a nominal damages instruction to avoid the tactical dilemma of choosing between compensatory damages and risking a zero-dollar verdict, as established in the Azimi v. Jordan's Meats, Inc. case."
"requirement applies to “for cause” drug testing as well as random drug testing. DOC chose not to apply these procedures in White’s case. DOC has never shown that its refusal to apply the established procedure in this case was anything other than arbitrary. The agency’s arbitrary abandonment of its published procedure encroached upon petitioner’s due process rights. See Wareham v. Singletary, 700 So.2d 427, 428 (Fla. 1st DCA 1997) (“In Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 94 S.Ct. 2963, 41 L.Ed.2d 935 (1974), the Supreme Court held that inmates facing disciplinary charges must be afforded certain minimal safeguards.”). By denying relief, the circuit court condoned the denial of due process. Certiorari is therefore appropriate. See Plymel v. Moore, 770 So.2d 242, 249 (Fla. 1st DCA 2000) (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we grant the petition for",Did the Department of Corrections violate the petitioner's due process rights by arbitrarily refusing to apply the established drug testing procedure?,"The question involves the potential violation of the petitioner's due process rights by the Department of Corrections (DOC) in their handling of drug testing procedures. In the case of Wareham v. Singletary, the court held that inmates facing disciplinary charges must be provided with certain minimal safeguards, as established in Wolff v. McDonnell. The petitioner argues that DOC's refusal to apply the established drug testing procedure in this case was arbitrary and encroached upon their due process rights. The petitioner asserts that DOC never provided a justification for deviating from the established procedure. The circuit court's denial of relief in this matter could be seen as condoning the denial of due process. Therefore, the petitioner is seeking certiorari as a means to address the alleged violation of their rights.","Yes, the Department of Corrections violated the petitioner's due process rights by arbitrarily refusing to apply the established drug testing procedure, as outlined in the Wareham v.

"contest, Johnson’s motion to intervene is not precluded by the three-month statutory period contained in Indiana Code section 29-1-7-18. Therefore, we reverse and remand with instructions that Johnson et al be named as a plaintiff in this will contest. Reversed and remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. DARDEN, J., and KIRSCH, J., concur. 1 . Morgan also maintains that because Johnson did not address the issue of whether the trial court properly dismissed her Interve-nor’s Complaint as untimely, it is waived. Because this issue is intricately linked with whether Johnson should have been named as a plaintiff to the proceeding rather than a defendant under Indiana Code section 29-1-17-7, we address it. 2 . But see Smith v. Mitchell, 841 N.E.2d 215, 217 (Ind.Ct.App.2006)",Can Johnson intervene as a plaintiff in the will contest despite the three-month statutory period?,"The issue at hand is whether Johnson can intervene as a plaintiff in the will contest even though the three-month statutory period stated in Indiana Code section 29-1-7-18 has passed. The court, in its decision, establishes that Johnson's motion to intervene is not precluded by the three-month statutory period. This means that Johnson can still be named as a plaintiff in the will contest. The court reasons that since Johnson's intervention is intricately linked with whether she should have been named as a plaintiff or defendant under Indiana Code section 29-1-17-7, her failure to address the issue of the timeliness of her complaint does not waive her right to intervene. Therefore, the court reverses the previous decision and remands the case with instructions to name Johnson as a plaintiff in the will contest.","Yes, Johnson can intervene as a plaintiff in the will contest despite the passing of the three-month statutory period, as established in the court's decision."
"between Allen and Forte. Id. at 1303. Importantly, the court observed that “contractors ... share an economic relationship and community of interest with the architect on a construction project,” id., and that “too much control over the contractor necessarily rests in the hands of the supervising architect for him not to be placed under a duty imposed by law to perform without negligence his functions as they affect the contractor.” Id. (quoting United States v. Rogers & Rogers, 161 F.Supp. 132, 136 (S.D.Cal.1958)). By recognizing an independent duty in tort, Forte Bros, represents an exception to the general rule propounded in Car-dente. Kennett, 798 A.2d at 418. The exception carries currency in the construction context, see Boren v. Thompson & Assoc., 999 P.2d 438, 445 (Okla.2000) (<HOLDING>), and has superficial appeal here, particularly","In the construction context, does an architect have a duty to perform without negligence when it affects the contractor?","The question pertains to the duty of an architect to perform without negligence in the construction context when it affects the contractor. According to the court's ruling in Forte Bros. v. Allen, contractors and architects share an economic relationship and a community of interest in a construction project. Due to the significant control that architects have over contractors, the court determined that architects have a duty imposed by law to perform their functions without negligence as it affects the contractor. This ruling represents an exception to the general rule established in Car-dente. The Kennett case supports this exception and it holds currency in the construction context. Consequently, the architect should have a duty to perform without negligence when it affects the contractor.","Yes, in the construction context, an architect does have a duty to perform without negligence when it affects the contractor, as established in the Forte Bros. v.

The court further stated in Edelman that waiver can only occur through express statements or overwhelming implication in the state's statutory or constitutional text. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate whether the state of KSU has explicitly waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity or if there is overwhelming implication of waiver in their statutory or constitutional text.","Eleventh Amendment immunity cannot be waived by a state through its affirmative conduct in the context of a federal program.

"contractors. Such decisions are not, of course, wholly immune from review. The Secretary’s discretion, like that of a prosecutor, remains “subject to constitutional constraints,” including those “imposed by the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.” Armstrong, 517 U.S. at 464, 116 S.Ct. 1480. Moreover, the Commission retains authority to adjudicate — subject to the appropriate standard of review — whether safety violations have in fact occurred. See 30 U.S.C. §§ 815(d), 823(d). In this case, however, Twentymile has stipulated that the conditions cited by the Secretary constitute violations of safety standards. See ALJ Decision, 25 F.M.S.H.R.C. at 353.

This means that the Secretary's decisions must comply with the principles of equal protection and due process as outlined in the Constitution. While the Secretary has the authority to make decisions about contractors, the Commission still retains the power to adjudicate whether safety violations have occurred.

The court's reasoning was based on the premise that ignoring known, likely injuries and abuse, and disregarding the danger posed to the victim can be seen as behavior that shocks the conscience. It should be noted, however, that further discovery may provide additional context that could potentially impact the interpretation of Booker's and Peagler's actions.","The actions of Booker and Peagler could potentially be considered conscience-shocking behavior in relation to their handling of Chandler's injuries and abuse, as established in the Currier v.

After a detailed hearing conducted August 8, 1994, at which Julian was thoroughly examined, the court denied the motion for new trial. As the postconviction court stated, “The underlying substance of this claim is clearly Mr. Julian’s potential bias, an issue which could have been raised on direct appeal because it was thoroughly addressed at the conclusion of the trial.” On this basis, the court rejected the claim as procedurally barred, finding that it could have been raised on direct appeal. To the extent Kimbrough seeks review of the substantive issue underlying his ineffective assistance of counsel claim, we agree. See Maharaj v. State, 684 So.2d 726 (Fla.1996) (<HOLDING>); see also Sireci v. State, 469 So.2d 119, 120",Is there a possibility to raise the issue of potential bias of Julian on direct appeal even though it was addressed during the trial?,"The question pertains to the possibility of raising the issue of potential bias of Julian on direct appeal. In this case, the postconviction court denied the motion for a new trial, stating that the issue of Julian's potential bias could have been raised on direct appeal as it was thoroughly addressed during the trial. The court found that the claim was procedurally barred since it could have been raised earlier. The decision in Maharaj v. State supports this reasoning, emphasizing that substantive issues underlying ineffective assistance of counsel claims can be reviewed on direct appeal. Therefore, based on the court's ruling and relevant case law, it is possible to raise the issue of potential bias of Julian on direct appeal, despite its previous consideration during the trial.","Yes, it is possible to raise the issue of potential bias of Julian on direct appeal, as stated by the postconviction court and supported by the decision in Maharaj v. State."
"and anti-competitive effects. For this reason, such restraints generally are not deemed per se illegal, but, rather, are tested under a rule of reason analysis. See Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp., 485 U.S. 717, 723, 108 S.Ct. 1515, 99 L.Ed.2d 808 (1988). Vertical price-fixing agreements, however, are a special subset of vertical restraints. As such, they qualify for different treatment. A vertical price-fixing agreement that establishes a minimum price normally is regarded as a naked restraint of trade and, thus, as illegal per se.

Generally, restraints of trade are not automatically deemed illegal but are instead evaluated using a rule of reason analysis. However, vertical price-fixing agreements are considered a distinct category of vertical restraints and are subject to different treatment. Such agreements that establish a minimum price are typically regarded as naked restraints of trade and are thus considered illegal per se. This was established in the Business Elecs. Corp. v. Sharp Elecs. Corp. case and further supported by the precedent set in Dr. Miles Med. Co. v. John D. Park & Sons Co. Additionally, State Oil Co. v. Khan reinforces this notion.

"but also extend it to proceedings involving the termination of parental rights. Even if the Minnesota courts were to adopt the doctrine of abatement, it is doubtful that the doctrine would be extended to cases involving termination of parental rights. Abatement rests primarily on the dual rationales that (1) the party in interest is no longer living and (2) his rights to an appeal cannot be vindicated. Carlin, 249 P.3d at 762; Wkitehouse v. State, 266 Ind. 527, 364 N.E.2d 1015, 1016 (1977). Here, although the child’s best interests were the central focus of the termination proceedings, appellant remains a real party in interest.

While the Minnesota courts have the authority to adopt the doctrine of abatement, it is unlikely that they would extend it to cases involving the termination of parental rights. The doctrine of abatement is based on two primary rationales: the party in interest is deceased, and their right to appeal cannot be upheld. However, in termination proceedings, the child's best interests are of utmost importance, and the parent remains a real party in interest, with constitutional rights at stake. Consequently, the termination order directly impacts the parent's constitutional rights, as established in the case of Stanley v. Illinois. Therefore, it is doubtful that the doctrine of abatement would apply to cases involving the termination of parental rights in Minnesota.",It is unlikely that the doctrine of abatement would be extended to cases involving the termination of parental rights in Minnesota due to the significance of the parent's constitutional rights and the focus on the child's best interests in such proceedings.
"in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth to determine whether any rational jury could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.” Commonwealth v. Ruci, 409 Mass. 94, 96 (1991) citing Commonwealth v. Latimore, supra at 676-677. The five elements of the offense of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior appear in Instruction 5.42 of the Model Jury Instructions for Use in the District Court (1988). While G. L. c. 272, § 16, does not itself define “open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,” these five elements were generated by our case law. See, e.g., Commonwealth v. Fitta, 391 Mass. 394, 396 (1984) (defendant’s act must be committed “in such a way as to produce alarm or shock”); Commonwealth v. Adams, 389 Mass. 265, 271-272 (1983) (<HOLDING>); Commonwealth v. Catlin, 1 Mass. 8, 10 (1804)",What are the elements that constitute the offense of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior in Massachusetts?,"The question pertains to the elements of the offense of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior in Massachusetts. In Commonwealth v. Fitta, the court established that the defendant's act must be committed in a manner that produces alarm or shock. Another element of the offense, as determined in Commonwealth v. Adams, is that the defendant's conduct must be open and public, causing embarrassment or offense to others. While G.L. c. 272, § 16, does not provide a specific definition for ""open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior,"" our case law generates these five elements. Therefore, to constitute the offense, the defendant's act must be committed in such a manner as to produce alarm or shock, it must be open and public, and it must cause embarrassment or offense to others.","The offense of open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior in Massachusetts is constituted by the defendant's act being committed in a manner that produces alarm or shock, being open and public, and causing embarrassment or offense to others.

France recognized that the rights of union members to belong to an open democratic labor organization are infringed when a dominant group tries to stifle dissent and reform through the removal of a political opponent from office. To meet the requirements of this exception, the plaintiff must show that her dismissal was part of a series of oppressive acts that directly threaten the freedom of members to speak out. This burden of proof is significant, requiring clear and convincing evidence.","Yes, a union member can claim that her dismissal was part of a series of oppressive acts by the union leadership that directly threaten the freedom of members to speak out if she can provide clear and convincing proof of this claim.

"a substantial risk of death or that causes death, serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ.” Tex. Pen.Code § 1.07(a)(46). The plain language of the statute therefore defines serious bodily injury in terms of bodily injury; though some forms of bodily injury are not “serious bodily injury,” all forms of “serious bodily injury” include bodily injury. Moreover, death is also bodily injury under the plain meaning of the Penal Code because it is an “impairment of physical condition.” See Tex. Pen.Code § 1.07(a)(8). In proving appellant caused the complainant’s death, the State necessarily had to prove that appellant caused bodily injury to the complainant. See Cumbie v. State, 578 S.W.2d 732, 735 (Tex.Crim.App.1979) (<HOLDING>), overruled on other grounds by Almanza v.",Does the definition of serious bodily injury in Texas Penal Code include death as a form of bodily injury?,"The question pertains to the interpretation of the definition of serious bodily injury in the Texas Penal Code. According to the statutory language in Texas Penal Code § 1.07(a)(46), serious bodily injury is defined as an injury that involves a substantial risk of death or causes death, serious permanent disfigurement, or protracted loss or impairment of bodily function. The plain language of the statute indicates that serious bodily injury encompasses bodily injury, including all forms of serious bodily injury. Additionally, the Penal Code explicitly includes death as a form of bodily injury under its definition of impairment of physical condition in § 1.07(a)(8). Therefore, as the State would need to prove that the appellant caused bodily injury to the complainant in order to establish the charge of causing the complainant's death, it can be concluded that death is considered bodily injury within the meaning of serious bodily injury as defined by the Texas Penal Code.","Yes, the definition of serious bodily injury in the Texas Penal Code includes death as a form of bodily injury, as stated in Texas Penal Code § 1.07(a)(46) and § 1.07(a)(8)."

The District Court denied Gerbier's request for habeas relief, citing that he was an aggravated felon and therefore not eligible for cancellation of removal. However, the court did permit Gerbier to apply for protection under CAT, which he declined. This suggests that even though Gerbier was not eligible for cancellation of removal, he could still potentially apply for protection under CAT. The INS v.

The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure, Article 36.29(a), provides the general rule that in a felony case, if a juror becomes disabled before the charge of the court is read to the jury, the remaining jurors have the power to render the verdict. This rule does not explicitly address the authority of the trial court to suggest the issue of competency. However, the trial court in this case expressed its suggestion of competency sua sponte, emphasizing that it was not due to any error or fault by either party. The case of Hill v.

Therefore, plaintiff has established the first two prongs of the test for a battery — namely, he has proved that there was bodily contact that was offensive in nature. Plaintiff must also prove that the offensive contact was “made with intent.” While the plaintiff must prove intentional contact, he “is not required to prove an intention to cause the specific injuries resulting from the contact.” Masters v.

"of retaliation Bell must first present evidence establishing a prima facie case — she has failed to do so. Specifically, Bell has not, and cannot demonstrate that she was terminated because of the EEOC claim she filed. Bell contends that the fact that her termination came seven months after her EEOC claim provides evidence of the causal connection. Mere timing alone is insufficient in this instance to satisfy the causation element of the prima facie case. B Even were a prima facie case established, Bell has failed to adequately refute the Bank’s legitimate non-discriminatory reason for its actions. Bank of America contends that it eliminated Bell and Barnhart’s positions due to restructuring in the corporation. See E.E.O.C. v. Tex.

The Wittenberg court premised its holding on its finding that “the statute on which the regulation is based does not contemplate a situation in which a hearing conducted by the state will be appealed to a state review official.” Id.; see also CJN v.

The Officers Had Probable Cause to Believe Thompson’s Car Was Subject to Seizure and Forfeiture Defendants claim they are entitled to summary judgment because Thompson’s vehicle was used in commission of an offense — aggravated fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer — that subjected his vehicle to forfeiture. See United States v. Pace, 898 F.2d 1218, 1241-42 (7th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>).

According to the decision in Duguay, impounding a vehicle is only valid if it is supported by probable cause of criminal activity and the arrestee is unable to remove the car quickly and efficiently from public areas. In this case, the defendants argue that Thompson's vehicle was used in the commission of an offense that subjected it to forfeiture, therefore justifying the seizure without a warrant. The United States v. Pace case supports the principle that police can seize vehicles without a warrant if they are linked to criminal activity. Hence, if the officers had probable cause to believe that Thompson's car was subject to seizure and forfeiture, it would be deemed lawful to impound it without a warrant.","Yes, it was lawful for the police to impound Thompson's car without a warrant if they had probable cause to believe that the vehicle was subject to seizure and forfeiture, as supported by the United States v.

"13-3.

See Dkt. No. 15 at 24. Under the IDEA, a student with a disability is eligible to earn a high school diploma until his or her twenty-first birthday. See 20 U.S.C. § 1412(a)(1)(A); 8 N.Y.C.R.R. § 100.9(e). At the time this action was brought, G.M. was fifteen years old, thus Defendant’s contention that she still has ample time to earn a Regents diploma is correct. Given G.M.’s significant deficits, however, Defendant’s decision that G.M. would not receive Carnegie credit for her course work for 2010-2011 does not amount to a violation of the IDEA.

"judgment entry makes clear that what the district court did was properly, albeit belatedly, decide questions of law on the basis of undisputed facts. The interpretation of an insurance policy presents a question of law for the court, not the jury, to decide. See, e.g., Diocese of Winona v. Interstate Fire & Casualty Co., 89 F.3d 1386, 1392 (8th Cir.1996); Marren v. Mutual Life Insurance Co., 84 F.3d 1068, 1070 (8th Cir.1996). Although the district court should have recognized appellants’ right to a jury trial, the district court correctly decided that it, and not the jury, was the decision-maker on the issue of contract interpretation, even though it effected that decision by improperly declaring the jury advisory. See, e.g., Alexander v. Gerhardt Enterprises, Inc., 40 F.3d at 191-93 (<HOLDING>); United States v.

According to Vasquez v. Jones and Boggs v. Collins, the state can limit these rights only if there are ""very substantial"" interests served by the limitation. The court in Chambers v. Mississippi further established that the state's interests must be significant. However, in this case, it is not clear why the trial limited the defendant's confrontation rights. Without a clear articulation of substantial state interests, it is unlikely that the limitation on the defendant's rights would be justifiable.

Although Defendants contend that evidence of Victim’s .245 percent BAC would have tended to show that Defendants were reasonable in their apprehension and that Victim was the first aggressor, Defendants have not supplied authority to support this proposition. There undoubtedly is in many instances a correlation between alcohol and violence. However, as the district court observed, although it is clear that BAC may demonstrate impaired ability to drive a motor vehicle, a correlation between BAC and aggressiveness seems speculative unless tied more specifically to an individual’s history. As such, the probative value of the BAC evidence in this case is questionable at best. Cf. id. ¶ 14 (<HOLDING>). Even if some relevance had been found, the",Is evidence of Victim's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) admissible to show that Defendants were reasonable in their apprehension and that Victim was the first aggressor?,"The question at hand concerns the admissibility of evidence regarding Victim's BAC to support the defendants' claim of reasonable apprehension and Victim being the initial aggressor. Defendants, however, have failed to provide any legal authority supporting this proposition. While there may be a general correlation between alcohol consumption and violence, the court observed that a link between BAC and aggressiveness is speculative unless it is specifically tied to an individual's history. Thus, the probative value of the BAC evidence in this particular case is questionable. Additionally, even if some relevance were to be found, the court in State v. Telles held that the district court has discretion in determining the admissibility of evidence (including BAC) based on its probative value. Therefore, without any supporting legal authority and considering the speculative nature of the correlation between BAC and aggressiveness, it is unlikely that the evidence of Victim's BAC would be admissible in this case.","No, evidence of Victim's blood alcohol concentration would likely not be admissible to show that Defendants were reasonable in their apprehension and that Victim was the first aggressor.

"The three-judge panel found that, in addition to complying with federal and state law, the General Assembly desired to create districts “more competitive for” the majority party.

In the Supreme Court case of Rapanos v. United States, the court presented two different tests. The first test, presented by the plurality, requires wetlands to have a continuous surface connection to a navigable water to fall under the CWA's jurisdiction. They emphasized that an intermittent and physically remote connection would not be sufficient. However, Justice Kennedy presented an alternative test that focuses on the existence of a significant nexus between the wetlands in question and navigable waters. This significant nexus must be evaluated in a case-by-case basis. The court's decision in United States v. Donovan also supports the use of a significant nexus test. Therefore, when determining whether wetlands fall under the jurisdiction of the CWA, one must consider the continuous surface connection test and the significant nexus test.","The test used to determine whether wetlands fall under the jurisdiction of the Clean Water Act is two-fold. One test, presented by the plurality in Rapanos v. United States, requires wetlands to have a continuous surface connection to a navigable water.

Both tests should be considered in evaluating wetlands' jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act."
"information to the government in 2007, Koerber did not file his protective-order motion until February 2010, nearly nine months after the grand jury’s indictment. In addition, Koerber did not file his motion to suppress statements from the February 2009 interviews until April 2012. Moreover, Koerber did not file a motion to dismiss for an STA violation until April 2014-nearly five years after the grand jury returned its initial indictment. At the same time, Koerber filed his motion before trial when it was clear that there was an STA violation in this case.

And Koerber did not simply acquiesce to",Can Koerber file a motion to dismiss for an STA violation even if he waited nearly five years after the grand jury returned its initial indictment?,"The question revolves around the timeliness of filing a motion to dismiss for an STA (Speedy Trial Act) violation. According to 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2), failure to move for dismissal prior to trial constitutes a waiver of the right to dismissal under this section. In United States v. Lugo, the court held that the defendant must file a motion to dismiss for an STA violation before trial. In this case, Koerber waited nearly five years after the grand jury's initial indictment to file the motion, which is well beyond the time limit set by the law. Therefore, it can be concluded that Koerber's delay in filing the motion to dismiss for an STA violation would likely result in a waiver of his right to seek dismissal under the STA.","No, Koerber cannot file a motion to dismiss for an STA violation if he waited nearly five years after the grand jury returned its initial indictment, as stated in 18 U.S.C. § 3162(a)(2) and the United States v.

Granting pendent appellate jurisdiction over other issues in this case could potentially encourage litigants to make meritless requests for stays as a means to challenge other non-appealable decisions. Furthermore, it is essential to consider that neither Taylor nor those who have joined her have agreed to arbitrate. The Reyna v.

The court emphasized the need for a comprehensive evaluation of the individual's competency to understand and make informed decisions regarding the waiver of rights.

It is conferred upon the courts either by the North Carolina Constitution or by statute. According to N.C. Gen. Stat. § 7B-200(a), the trial court has exclusive, original jurisdiction over cases involving allegations of abuse, neglect, or dependency of a juvenile. Once jurisdiction of a court attaches, it exists until the cause is fully and completely determined. This means that once a court has subject matter jurisdiction over a case, it retains the authority to act on that case until it is resolved. It is essential for the court to have subject matter jurisdiction in order to properly handle and adjudicate the specific type of legal action at hand.","Subject matter jurisdiction is the power of the court to deal with a particular type of legal action. In the context of the North Carolina legal system, it is conferred upon the courts either by the state constitution or by statute.

Once subject matter jurisdiction is established, it remains in effect until the case is fully resolved."
"of temporary insanity, trial counsel were not deficient for failing to further investigate and pursue the defense. See Sawyers v. State, 724 S.W.2d 24 (Tex.Crim.App.1986) (evidence showing the defendant was intoxicated and nothing more does not justify submission of an issue on temporary insanity, and refusal to submit such charge in mitigation of punishment is not error); Ex parte Lilly, 656 S.W.2d 490, 493 (Tex.Crim.App.1983) (counsel’s failure to investigate the facts of a case constitutes ineffectiveness if the result is that any viable defense available to the accused was not advanced). We conclude that, had counsel requested an instruction on temporary insanity as a mitigating factor, it would have been properly denied. See Hart v. State, 537 S.W.2d 21, 24 (Tex.Crim.App.1976) (<HOLDING>). Similarly, because applicant knew his","If trial counsel failed to investigate and pursue the defense of temporary insanity, can it be considered as deficient representation?","The question pertains to the adequacy of trial counsel's representation in the context of the defense of temporary insanity. The Sawyers v. State case establishes that evidence of intoxication alone is insufficient to justify submitting an issue on temporary insanity for trial. Furthermore, under Ex parte Lilly, the failure of counsel to investigate the facts of a case may constitute ineffective assistance of counsel if it results in the omission of any viable defense. In this case, if trial counsel did not request an instruction on temporary insanity as a mitigating factor, the denial of such a request would have been appropriate based on the precedent established in Hart v.

Therefore, if trial counsel failed to investigate and pursue the defense of temporary insanity, it can be considered as deficient representation.","Yes, if trial counsel failed to investigate and pursue the defense of temporary insanity, it can be seen as deficient representation, as per the precedents set in Sawyers v.

"with the children, is well within its discretion to award primary physical custody to the other parent. Also on appeal from the divorce decree, Colleen argues that the district court abused its discretion by not compelling Terry to prepare and turn over certain tax returns for the purpose of the division of community property and debt. Yet, in her opening brief, Colleen states that she does not challenge the district court’s division of community property and debt, but rather is challenging the fact that the court declined her request for pretrial discovery. Since Colleen does not challenge the ultimate distribution of community property and debt, we do not reach her argument concerning pretrial discovery. See Cottonwood Cove Corp. v. Bates, 86 Nev. 751, 476 P.2d 171 (1970) (<HOLDING>). 10 See Sims v.

In addition, there is substantial evidence that the construction documents produced by MLS were to be approved by either Comer or another engineer. Gregory Gardiner in his deposition even stated that he believed the services performed by MLS were engineering by nature and that the surveying services were incidental to the engineering work. While his statements are not dispositive as to the nature of the contract, they show that Gardiner believed MLS was to perform engineering services for his company. Under such circumstances, we believe that both the engineering and land surveying services encompassed by the cohtract are properly classified as professional and thus, are subject to KRS 413.245. See Vandevelde, 744 S.W.2d at 433 (<HOLDING>). It is important to note that while this","Based on the evidence provided, can the services performed by MLS be classified as professional services and subject to KRS 413.245?","The question pertains to the classification of the services performed by MLS. The evidence presented indicates that MLS was responsible for both land surveying tasks and the production of construction documents, which were to be approved by an engineer. Gregory Gardiner, in his deposition, expressed his belief that MLS's services were engineering in nature and that surveying was incidental to their engineering work. Although Gardiner's statements are not determinative, they demonstrate that Gardiner perceived MLS to be providing engineering services. Considering these circumstances, it is reasonable to classify both the engineering and land surveying services provided by MLS as professional services. This classification would make them subject to KRS 413.245, which likely governs professional services. The case of Vandevelde, which held that professional services are covered under KRS 413.245, provides additional support for this reasoning.","Yes, based on the evidence presented, the services performed by MLS can be classified as professional services and would therefore be subject to KRS 413.245."

But the allegations are for a simple breach of an oral contract — Figaro-la borrowed $25,000 from the Walkers which he promised to repay within three weeks, and the loan remains unpaid. The complaint thus alleges a failure to comply with the terms of the contract. The Walkers had four years to bring a breach of contract action against Figarola, but they failed to do so. They cannot now seek a remedy in tort for a debt which could have been discharged by the payment of money by simply alleging that Figarola never intended to keep his promise to repay the debt.

He cites the case of Gall v. Parker in the Sixth Circuit, where habeas relief was granted based on the government's failure to prove the absence of EED.

All defendants initially argued the plaintiffs’ antitrust claims were frivolous, unreasonable, without foundation, and brought in bad faith based on the immunity provided by HCQIA and TMPA. But, not all of the plaintiffs’ claims relied upon actions allegedly taken in the context of a peer review or medical committee; therefore, any immunity under HCQIA and TMPA did not entirely shield the defendants from liability.

However, we will have no duty to defend an “insured” against any “suit” seeking “damages” for a “wrongful act” to which this insurance does not apply. In NCAIG’s view, because the Maxum failed to show that Mulberry subjectively believed that the issuance of the fraudulent insurance would result in a claim, it also breached its duty to defend the litigation, and is therefore liable for the default judgment. See Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co., 65 Cal.2d 263, 279, 54 Cal.Rptr. 104, 419 P.2d 168 (1966) (<HOLDING>).

The case of Gray v. Zurich Ins. Co. supports this argument, stating that an insurer must defend the insured unless it can establish that coverage clearly does not exist.

"we cannot say that § 1396r-5(e)(2)(C) has a “plain meaning” that mandates a resource-first approach. The MCCA does not set out a definition of income as that term is used in subsection (e)(2)(c). Further, unlike the district court, we do not read subsections (b), (d)(e) and'(f) as imparting a plain meaning that prohibits the transfer of income pre-eligibility, such that transferred income cannot be included in the community spouse’s income as that term is used in subsection (e)(2)(C). Instead, we believe that subsection (e)(2)(C)’s reference to “income” is ambiguous at best. Indeed, the differing views of the various courts and agencies that have interpreted subsection (e)(2)(C) provide a strong indication that the subsection is ambiguous. Compare, e.g., Gruber, 647 N.E.2d at 861 (<HOLDING>), and Kimnach, 645 N.E.2d at 825 (same), with",Is there a clear definition of income in the MCCA that prohibits the transfer of income pre-eligibility?,"The question revolves around the interpretation of subsection (e)(2)(C) of § 1396r-5(e)(2)(C) in the MCCA.

The absence of a clear definition, coupled with differing interpretations by various courts and agencies, suggests that the subsection is indeed ambiguous. While the district court took a resource-first approach, it cannot be concluded that § 1396r-5(e)(2)(C) mandates such an approach.

Because § 1651 does not constitute a grant of jurisdiction, but instead merely empowers federal courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of respective jurisdiction, and because it would not have jurisdiction over McVeigh’s anticipated Rule 60(b) motion, the district court concluded that it must deny McVeigh’s request for a stay. See Hatch v. Oklahoma, 92 F.3d 1012, 1017 (10th Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>) (citing Barefoot v.

As the district court would not have jurisdiction over McVeigh's Rule 60(b) motion, it concluded that it must deny McVeigh's request for a stay.

No. AMD 04-3422, 2006 WL 173690, at *4 (D.Md. Jan. 25, 2006). In that case, the Court found racial harassment that included the use of phrases such as “black dummy” and “black bitch” did not create a hostile work environment. While the Rose court held that those insults were not racial in nature, this Court has identified a number of other cases within the Fourth Circuit wherein the use of the word “black” as a modifier for otherwise racially-neutral insults was, in fact, considered race-based harassment.

The city's obligation to cover such defense costs arises from the Oregon Tort Claims Act (OTCA). The OTCA stipulates when the state and its subdivisions are obligated to expend public funds to address tort claims. The legislature expanded the OTCA in 1975 to include the financial responsibility of the state and its subdivisions for tort claims against their employees. However, it is important to note that the OTCA is specifically directed towards tort claims and not other types of claims. In the case of City of Tualatin v. City-County Ins. Services Trust, the Supreme Court clarified that ORS 30.287, which is part of the OTCA, is intended for tort claims. Therefore, the city can be held liable to indemnify a public employee for defense costs arising from willful or wanton misconduct, as long as it falls within the scope of tort claims covered by the OTCA.","Yes, the city can be held liable to indemnify a public employee for defense costs arising from willful or wanton misconduct, as long as it falls within the scope of tort claims covered by the Oregon Tort Claims Act."
"Under § 15-18-8, Austin must serve a minimum of 3 years, but no more than 5 years, in confinement. The circuit court, therefore, did not have jurisdiction to order that Austin serve only 26 months in confinement. Accordingly, we must again remand this case for the circuit court to conduct another sentencing hearing and to again reconsider the execution of Austin’s 20-year sentence. As we stated in our original opinion: “Because the 20-year sentence was valid, the circuit court may not change it. See Wood[ v. State, 602 So.2d 1195 (Ala.Crim.App.1992)].

Under § 15-18-8, Austin is required to serve a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5 years in confinement. The circuit court exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering a confinement period of only 26 months, as this falls outside the statutory range. As established in Wood v. State, the court does not have the power to alter a valid sentence. However, the court does have the discretion to either split the sentence in accordance with § 15-18-8 (with no more than 5 years in confinement and no less than 3 years), or, if it determines that splitting the sentence is not appropriate, to conduct another sentencing hearing to reconsider the execution of Austin's 20-year sentence.","No, the circuit court does not have the authority to change the 20-year sentence imposed on Austin.

This ruling is supported by the principle that testifying is a personal right and cannot be compelled against a person's wishes. Other cases such as Kinetic Energy Dev. Corp. v.

The Court highlighted that the language used in Title IX is broad and does not have the same requirements as Title VII. If the statute had followed the same wording as Title VII, the Court may have accepted the Board's position.

"Ventures § 12 (1969)).” Flowers v. Pope, 937 So.2d 61, 65-66 (Ala.2006). The record does not contain substantial evidence to create a jury question with regard to the existence of a joint venture involving Hyundai. Nothing in the evidence supports a finding of a community of interest. Hyundai never had a joint ownership interest with any of the alleged joint venturers in the property of the Rus-sells or the McLemore group upon the closings on the property. Additionally, Hyundai did not provide financing for the purchase of the property, and it had no risk or expenses with regard to the purchase. Thus, nothing supports a finding of a community of interest involving Hyundai with regard to the acquisition of the property to constitute the project site. Cf. Flowers v.

Moreover, the record indicates that Hyundai",Is there sufficient evidence to establish a joint venture involving Hyundai in the acquisition of the property?,"The question pertains to the existence of a joint venture involving Hyundai in the acquisition of the property. The court in Flowers v. Pope determined that for a joint venture to exist, there must be a community of interest, joint ownership, and shared risk or expenses. In this case, there is no evidence to support a finding of a community of interest between Hyundai and the alleged joint venturers. Hyundai did not have joint ownership, provide financing, or bear any risk or expenses in the purchase of the property. Therefore, based on the absence of these elements, there is insufficient evidence to establish a joint venture involving Hyundai in the acquisition of the property.","No, there is not sufficient evidence to establish a joint venture involving Hyundai in the acquisition of the property, as determined in the Flowers v.

"judicial opinions for the meaning of economic loss will support the conclusion that all monetary damages are economic. Unfortunately, the imprecise use of the term “economic loss rule” by this court led many to erroneously conclude that it was a rule of general application that precluded recovery in tort of virtually any harm that could be measured in dollars if a business relationship also existed between the parties. Ill ¶56 Third, again, the independent duty doctrine is not a rule at all; rather it is an analytical tool used by courts to decide whether there is an independent duty cognizable in tort in the first instance.

However, a closer examination of judicial opinions regarding the meaning of economic loss reveals that all monetary damages are considered economic in nature. Furthermore, the ""economic loss rule"" is not a universally applicable rule, but rather an analytical tool used by the courts to determine whether an independent duty, recognized in tort law, exists in a given situation. The recognition of such a duty is often influenced by policy considerations. Thompson v. St. Regis Paper Co. is an example wherein policy considerations played a role in determining whether a tort could be recognized.","The use of the ""economic loss rule"" does not automatically preclude the recovery of monetary damages in tort cases where a business relationship is involved. The term itself has been misconstrued to imply a broader restriction. Instead, all monetary damages are considered economic in nature. The ""economic loss rule"" serves as a tool for courts to assess whether there is an independent duty recognized in tort law, which is further influenced by policy considerations. Therefore, the ability to recover monetary damages in cases involving a business relationship is contingent on whether an independent duty is established. Thompson v. St. Regis Paper Co. is an example wherein policy considerations affected the recognition of a tort."
"Admission Agreement would be equally vulnerable. {39} Additionally, we disagree with the district court’s comments in the present case that a written power of attorney or an enumerated list authorizing Ms. Chapman to take each specific step was required to indicate the scope of her agency. Rather, Ms. Barron, as the principal, was in a position to limit her agent’s authority if she so chose. Cf. Comstock, 110 N.M. at 132, 793 P.2d at 262 (stating that “[i]t is always competent for a principal to limit the authority of his agent, and if such limitations have been brought to the attention of the party with whom the agent is dealing, the power to bind the principal is defined thereby”); Morris Oil Co. v. Rainbow Oilfield Trucking, Inc., 106 N.M. 237, 240, 741 P.2d 840, 844 (Ct.App.1987) (<HOLDING>).

In the present case, the court disagrees with the district court's requirement for such written documentation, stating that the principal has the right to limit their agent's authority if they choose to do so. This is supported by the Comstock case, which affirms that a principal can restrict the authority of their agent, and if these limitations are made known to the party with whom the agent is dealing, it defines the power to bind the principal. Additionally, the Morris Oil Co. v. Rainbow Oilfield Trucking case further supports this reasoning. Therefore, a written power of attorney or enumerated list is not required for a principal to limit the authority of their agent in New Mexico.","No, a principal does not need a written power of attorney or enumerated list of authorization to limit the authority of their agent in New Mexico, as established in the Comstock and Morris Oil Co. v.

The court's expeditious approach aligns with the principle established in McGill v. Goff, where a careful review was conducted efficiently.","Time plays a crucial role in the case between J.A. Besteman Company and Carter's Inc. due to the uncertain status of Carter's Inc., its potential actions, and the assets associated with Besteman's PACA trust. Given the urgency of the matter, the court has conducted an expedited but thorough review, following the approach established in McGill v. Goff."
"thus the claims against them were properly dismissed. V. Dismissal of the Malicious Prosecution Claim The District Court dismissed the malicious prosecution claim because the allegedly malicious prosecution had not terminated in McGee’s favor, as required by New York law. We agree. The prosecution against McGee terminated when, pursuant to N.Y. CPL § 170.30(l)(a), the accusatory instrument was dismissed as facially insufficient to state a claim for witness tampering. A55-56. We have held that a dismissal under CPL § 170.30 for facial insufficiency is “not a decision on the merits, an essential element of a cause of action for malicious prosecution.” Breen v. Garrison, 169 F.3d 152, 153 (2d Cir.1999); see also MacFawn v. Kresler, 88 N.Y.2d 859, 644 N.Y.S.2d 486, 666 N.E.2d 1359 (1996) (<HOLDING>). McGee relies upon Smithy-Hunter v. Harvey in","Based on the termination of the prosecution against McGee, can the malicious prosecution claim be dismissed?","The question here revolves around the dismissal of the malicious prosecution claim. In this case, the prosecution against McGee was dismissed under N.Y. CPL § 170.30(l)(a) because the accusatory instrument was found to be facially insufficient to establish a claim for witness tampering. It is important to note that a dismissal under CPL § 170.30 for facial insufficiency does not constitute a decision on the merits, which is an essential element for a malicious prosecution claim. This is supported by the Breen v. Garrison case, where it was established that a dismissal under CPL § 170.30 is not a decision on the merits. Additionally, the MacFawn v. Kresler case also supports this reasoning. Therefore, considering that the prosecution against McGee did not terminate in his favor, as required by New York law, the dismissal of the malicious prosecution claim is justified.","Yes, the malicious prosecution claim can be dismissed since the prosecution against McGee did not terminate in his favor, as required by New York law, as supported by the Breen v. Garrison and MacFawn v. Kresler cases."

These issues are of general public concern and are protected under the First Amendment. The Connick v. Myers case supports this reasoning by establishing that matters of public concern are protected speech.

"of habeas corpus, the Supreme Court noted that a district judge in an extradition proceeding is acting pursuant to special powers and not any part of the judicial power of the United States. Id. at 120, 14 How. 103 (citing to Ferreira, 54 U.S. (13 How.) at 48). Modern courts continue to rely on the concepts expressed in Ferreira and Kaine in determining that 18 U.S.C. § 3184 does not violate the principle of separation of powers. See In re Extradition of Kirby, 106 F.3d 855, 864 n. 11 (9th Cir.1996) (noting that 18 U.S.C. § 3184 does not violate principles of separation of powers because a long line of precedents hold that a district judge acting pursuant to Section 3184 does not exercise any part of the judicial power of the United States); Lo Duca v.

There are additional reasons why a court may","Can the provision of 18 U.S.C. § 3184, relating to extradition proceedings, be considered a violation of the principle of separation of powers?","The question involves whether 18 U.S.C. § 3184, which governs extradition proceedings, violates the principle of separation of powers. In the case of Ferreira, it was established that a district judge in an extradition proceeding is not exercising any part of the judicial power of the United States but rather acting pursuant to special powers. This concept was further affirmed in the case of Kaine. Modern courts, such as the Ninth Circuit in the case of In re Extradition of Kirby, have relied on these concepts to conclude that 18 U.S.C. § 3184 does not violate the principle of separation of powers. Additionally, the Second Circuit in the case of Lo Duca v. U.S. held a similar view. Therefore, based on the precedent established in these cases and the understanding that extradition proceedings involve special powers rather than judicial power, it can be concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 3184 does not violate the principle of separation of powers.","No, 18 U.S.C. § 3184, which governs extradition proceedings, does not violate the principle of separation of powers, as established in the cases of Ferreira, Kaine, In re Extradition of Kirby, and Lo Duca v.

The circuit court, however, found that Minehan was not in custody for purposes of Miranda, a finding we uphold after examining several cases and closely reading the transcript of the interrogation. Custody means a formal arrest, or another serious restriction on freedom of movement. See Miranda, 384 U.S. at 477, 86 S.Ct. 1602. It is an objective state that is entered when a suspect is “led to believe, as a reasonable person, that he is being deprived or restricted of his freedom of action or movement under pressures of official authority.” Bond v. State, 142 Md.App. 219, 228, 788 A.2d 705 (2002) (citations omitted) (<HOLDING>). Practically speaking, we must consider: where",Was Minehan considered to be in custody for purposes of Miranda during the interrogation?,"The question revolves around whether Minehan was in custody for purposes of Miranda during the interrogation. According to Rhode Island v. Innis and Drury v. State, custody refers to a formal arrest or another significant restriction on freedom of movement. The circuit court, after careful examination of relevant cases and a close reading of the interrogation transcript, concluded that Minehan was not in custody for Miranda purposes. The determination of custody is an objective state entered when a suspect reasonably believes that they are being deprived or restricted of their freedom of action or movement under the pressures of official authority, as explained in Bond v. State. Therefore, considering all these factors, it can be inferred that Minehan was not in custody during the interrogation for purposes of Miranda.","No, Minehan was not considered to be in custody for purposes of Miranda during the interrogation, as determined by the circuit court after examining relevant cases and the interrogation transcript."

In addition, Siemens has stated that when installation services are provided, “they are part and parcel of the contract for sale of equipment to the customer.” These are clear indications that Siemens has provided recurrent work for installation services as defined by the Kentucky courts.

Sherman & Fletcher, 705 S.W.2d 459, 462 (Ky.1986) (finding that “a person who engages another to perform a part of the work which is a recurrent part of his business, trade, or occupation is a contractor”).

"abuse”. There is no evidence in the record that the insureds’ understanding of the coverage departed in any way from that of the insurer’s. Even when we resolve all doubts concerning the meaning of the language employed in the policy in favor of the insured, we conclude that the notice concerns discussed in Canadian Universal are not invoked in this ease. Even if we were to agree with the Martins that NUFIC failed to provide adequate notice of a substantial reduction of coverage in this case, the appellants would nonetheless be unsuccessful. Although NUFIC’s earlier claims-made policy did not contain explicit exclusions for acts of sexual and physical abuse, such acts, nonetheless, are not covered as a matter of public policy. See D.W.H. v. Steele, 512 N.W.2d 586, 589 (Minn.1994) (<HOLDING>). b.

Even when resolving any doubts in favor of the insured, it can be concluded that the notice provisions discussed in Canadian Universal are not applicable in this situation. Even if it is agreed that the insurer did not adequately inform about the reduction in coverage, the insureds would still be unsuccessful in their argument. This is because acts of sexual and physical abuse are not covered under the insurer's policy due to public policy reasons, regardless of the presence or absence of explicit exclusions for such acts. This is supported by the case of D.W.H. v. Steele.","No, the insureds cannot argue that the insurer failed to provide adequate notice of a substantial reduction of coverage in this case due to the non-coverage of acts of sexual and physical abuse as a matter of public policy, as established in D.W.H. v.

"this issue. Kinman states in her affidavit that initially she did not welcome McDougall’ F.3d 1006 (5th Cir.1996) (refusing to hold school district Hable for student-on-student harassment unless the school itself directly discriminated based on sex). The divergence of views on this issue stems in part from the factual disparity in the cases. Title IX cases vary in both the type of discrimination alleged (hostile environment, quid pro quo, sexual abuse, discriminatory hiring/firing, or some combination) and in the identity of the perpetrators and victims (teacher/student harassment, stu dent/student harassment, or school official/teacher harassment). But even those courts which have addressed similar fact patterns have varied in their holdings. Compare Bosley, 904 F.Supp. at 1022 (<HOLDING>) with Rowinsky, 80 F.3d 1006 (refusing to hold",Can a school district be held responsible for student-on-student harassment under Title IX unless the school itself directly discriminates based on sex?,"The question revolves around whether a school district can be held accountable for student-on-student harassment under Title IX. There is a divergence of views on this issue, which stems from variations in the type of discrimination alleged and the identity of the perpetrators and victims in Title IX cases. Courts have differed in their holdings, even when faced with similar fact patterns. For example, the Bosley case held the school district responsible for student-on-student harassment, but the Rowinsky case refused to impose such liability. The ruling in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education, 526 U.S. 629 (1999) did not directly address this specific issue. Therefore, it is uncertain whether a school district can be held responsible for student-on-student harassment under Title IX unless the school itself engages in direct sex-based discrimination.","The question of whether a school district can be held responsible for student-on-student harassment under Title IX, absent direct sex-based discrimination by the school, lacks a definitive answer due to the divergence of views among courts and variations in the facts of Title IX cases. Determining liability in such cases will depend on the specific circumstances and the court's interpretation of the law."
"waive” the alleged error). We discern no plain error. Viewed in context of the entire trial, see United States v. Christians, 200 F.3d 1124, 1128 (8th Cir.1999), it is not clear or obvious that the prosecutor was commenting indi rectly on Kieffer’s failure to testify. Kieffer was attempting to convince the jury that the Ninth Circuit’s decision to admit Kieffer to practice somehow relieved Kieffer of responsibility for his own deceitful conduct. In stating Kieffer was “not accepting ... responsibility,” the prosecutor apparently was rebutting Kieffer’s defense. The prosecutor probably was deflecting Kieffer’s attempt to shift blame, emphasizing the District of North Dakota’s attorney admission system was based on trust and the jury should not “lose sight of who is on trial.” Cf. id. (<HOLDING>). 3. Sufficiency of the Evidence Kieffer argues",Did the prosecutor's statement indirectly comment on Kieffer's failure to testify?,"The question pertains to whether the prosecutor's statement can be deemed as indirectly commenting on Kieffer's failure to testify. In order to determine this, the court must examine the statement in the context of the entire trial, as per the ruling in United States v. Christians. The statement made by the prosecutor seems to be in response to Kieffer's defense, wherein he attempted to absolve himself of responsibility for his deceptive behavior by citing his admission to practice law by the Ninth Circuit. By stating that Kieffer was ""not accepting responsibility,"" the prosecutor appears to be countering this defense and emphasizing that the trial should focus on Kieffer's actions rather than shifting blame. Therefore, it is not explicitly clear or obvious that the prosecutor directly commented on Kieffer's failure to testify.","No, it is not clear or obvious that the prosecutor indirectly commented on Kieffer's failure to testify in this case."

Consequently, the inquiry here is whether Plaintiffs argument that Defendant actually is not a municipality, and thus the punitive damages immunity is inapplicable, is valid. (See Br. in Opp’n (Doc. 21) at 13.) “The board of education of each county in the State shall be a body corporate ....” N.C. Gen. Stat., § 115C-40. Among other powers, duc., 315 F.Supp.2d 784, 810 (M.D.N.C.2004) (“Defendant Guilford County Board of Education is a governmental entity and therefore is immune from punitive damages,” (citation omitted)); Long v.

Ass’n, 158",Is Defendant immune from punitive damages if it is argued that Defendant is not a municipality?,"The issue at hand is whether Defendant, which is argued to be not a municipality, is immune from punitive damages. In Vt. Agency of Nat. Res, v. United States, the Supreme Court stated that punitive damages are generally not imposed on governmental entities. However, to determine if this punitive damages immunity applies, it is crucial to establish if Defendant is actually a municipality. According to N.C. Gen. Stat., § 115C-40, the board of education of each county in the State is a body corporate. Previous cases, such as duc., 315 F.Supp.2d 784, 810 and Long v. City of Charlotte, 306 N.C. 187, 208, have recognized that Defendant, the Guilford County Board of Education, is a governmental entity and thus immune from punitive damages. Therefore, if it is successfully argued that Defendant is not a municipality, the punitive damages immunity may not be applicable.","If it is argued successfully that Defendant is not a municipality, it may be possible to challenge Defendant's immunity from punitive damages. However, previous cases have recognized Defendant, the Guilford County Board of Education, as a governmental entity and therefore immune from punitive damages. Therefore, there is a strong likelihood that Defendant will maintain its immunity from punitive damages."
"fully accept this principle but find it inapplicable here. Where the indictment includes, as here, specific, narrowing language “descriptive of the offense charged,” we cannot treat it as immaterial “surplusage.” Commonwealth v. Nuckles, 266 Va. 519, 523, 587 S.E.2d 695, 697 (2003); see also Etheridge, 210 Va. at 330, 171 S.E.2d at 192. In short, we hold a fatal variance existed between the indictments against Purvy and the proof offered by the prosecution at trial. For this reason, his convictions cannot stand. II. Sufficiency of the Evidence Purvy also contends the evidence was insufficient to prove the unindicted variant offenses for which he was convicted—specifically, violating Code § 18.2-472.1(B) by “knowingly providing] materially false information” i at 435-36 (15th ed.1993) (<HOLDING>), with Farr, 536 F.3d at 1186-87 (recognizing",Was there a fatal variance between the indictments against Purvy and the proof offered by the prosecution at trial?,"The existence of a fatal variance between the indictments and the proof offered by the prosecution at trial is a crucial consideration. In this case, the indictments against Purvy included specific language that described the offense charged. It is established in Commonwealth v. Nuckles and Etheridge that such specific and narrowing language cannot be treated as immaterial surplusage. Therefore, it can be concluded that a fatal variance did exist in this case, as the proof offered by the prosecution did not align with the specific language used in the indictments.","Yes, there was a fatal variance between the indictments against Purvy and the proof offered by the prosecution at trial."

Paulson himself admitted during his deposition that Shi-rey and Ford were simply doing their job and no personal grudges or vendettas were involved. He further acknowledged that there was no evidence to suggest that Shirey handled the investigation with the intention to harm him. Based on this deposition testimony, the court determined that Paulson failed to provide any evidence indicating a factual dispute. In the State ex rel. Bossung v. District Court case, it was established that a legislature cannot create a transitory cause of action and limit its enforcement to its own courts, indicating that the nature of the claim plays a crucial role. Therefore, considering that Paulson admitted there was no evidence of intentional harm and that his claim lacks factual support, the court concluded that there was no evidence indicating a factual issue in his case.","No, Paulson did not provide evidence showing that there was a factual issue in his case against Shi-rey and Ford for intentionally harming him during the investigations."

In this case, the parties' execution of an escrow agreement alongside the deed, which pertained only to the conveyance itself, clearly demonstrates that they did not intend to merge the conditions of the agreement into the deed.

However, if the calculation of damages needs to be done individually for each class member, it may be a valid ground for denying class certification. This was established in the Bell Atlantic case, where it was held that the necessity of individual damages calculations alone can be a reason to not certify a class.

The determination of whether the defendant's substantial rights were affected is based on whether the error influenced the defendant's decision to plead guilty and impaired their ability to evaluate the risks associated with accepting criminal responsibility.

This means that the court has the authority to weigh the evidence presented and make factual determinations accordingly. However, the limited partners hold a different perspective. In Pelfrey v. Bank of Greer, the court established that derivative actions are cognizable in equity. In equity cases, the court has the power to apply equitable principles and remedies, and the findings are based on fairness and justice rather than solely on the preponderance of the evidence.

However, in this case, the department did not have the matter of Inner Harbour's rights under the adoption agreement before them, and therefore, they did not make any decision, final or otherwise, regarding it.

Associated Ins. Cos. Inc., 29 F.3d 1244, 1249 (7th Cir.1994) (citing Gomez v. Toledo, 446 U.S. 635, 638-40, 100 S.Ct. 1920, 1923-24, 64 L.Ed.2d 572 (1980)).

The court stated that the dissipation of the taint resulting from an illegal seizure usually involves a significant intervening time, space, or event. Since there was no significant intervening time, space, or event in this case, the first two factors from the Brown case argue in favor of suppressing the evidence.

"can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.” 355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99. Heeding this mandate, some prevailing case law inclined to the pleading leniency Conley demanded. In securities fraud cases, despite the particularity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) for averments constituting the circumstances of the fraud asserted and the scienter requirement Hochfelder propounded, some courts permitted generalized pleadings or relaxed specificity of the requisite fraudulent intent to survive motions to dismiss, relying for authority on the language of Rule 9(b) itself, which provides that “malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind, may be averred generally”. See In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec. Litig., 42 F.3d 1541, 1547 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc) (<HOLDING>); see also Cosmas, 886 F.2d at 12 (noting that","In securities fraud cases, can generalized pleadings or relaxed specificity of the requisite fraudulent intent survive motions to dismiss?","The question relates to the leniency of pleading requirements in securities fraud cases.

This leniency is based on the language of Rule 9(b) itself, which allows for averring malice, intent, knowledge, and other conditions of mind generally. In the case of In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec.

"the subject: Plaintiff included a copy of the 2001 EEOC Complaint with his application on June 30, 2005 — twelve days before Plaintiffs interview with Schlem-mer. {See Michael Henshaw Decl. ¶ 4, June 19, 2007) Plaintiff had earlier stated at oral argument that it was Schlemmer who first brought up the 2001 EEOC Complaint. (Mem.Op.4, Apr. 4, 2007) The only genuine issue is which party first broached the subject. For purposes of Plaintiffs prima facie case, it is sufficient that Defendant was aware of the protected activity, regardless of which party first brought up the issue. Defendant argues, however, that in Title VII retaliation cases, “generally the passage of time ... tends to negate the infer- enee of discrimination.” Price, 380 F.3d at 213; see also Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657 (<HOLDING>). Although Defendant’s argument is true,",Did the timing of the disclosure of the 2001 EEOC Complaint by the plaintiff to Schlemmer impact the defendant's liability in a Title VII retaliation case?,"The issue at hand is whether the timing of the disclosure of the 2001 EEOC Complaint by the plaintiff to Schlemmer affects the defendant's liability in a Title VII retaliation case. Although the defendant argues that the passage of time tends to diminish the inference of discrimination in Title VII retaliation cases, it is important to note that for the plaintiff's prima facie case, it is sufficient that the defendant was aware of the protected activity, regardless of which party brought up the issue first. Therefore, in this case, even if Schlemmer was the one who initially brought up the 2001 EEOC Complaint, the defendant's liability for retaliation is not affected by the timing of its disclosure.","No, the timing of the disclosure of the 2001 EEOC Complaint by the plaintiff to Schlemmer does not impact the defendant's liability in a Title VII retaliation case.

"The High Court has explicitly affirmed that voir dire is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding, during which the defendant has a constitutional right to be present. Gomez v. United States, 490 U.S. 858, 873, 109 S.Ct. 2237, 104 L.Ed.2d 923 (1989) (citing Lewis, supra at 374,13 S.Ct. 136). The determination that voir dire is a critical stage of trial flows directly from the recognition that a defendant’s “life or liberty may depend upon the aid which, by his personal presence, he may give to counsel and to the court and triers in the selection of jurors.” Lewis, supra at 373, 13 S.Ct. 136. However, certain decisions regarding the conduct of voir dire are properly made by counsel alone. See, e.g., Gonzalez v. United States, 553 U.S. 242, 128 S.Ct. 1765, 170 L.Ed.2d 616 (2009[2008]) (<HOLDING>). The High Court has also stated: The mere",Is the defendant required to be present during the voir dire stage of a criminal proceeding?,"The question pertains to the defendant's presence during voir dire. In Gomez v. United States, the High Court affirmed that the defendant has a constitutional right to be present during the voir dire stage of a criminal proceeding. This recognition stems from the understanding that the selection of jurors is crucial and the defendant's personal presence can aid counsel and the court in this process, as it directly impacts the defendant's life or liberty.

United States.","Yes, the defendant is required to be present during the voir dire stage of a criminal proceeding, according to the High Court's affirmation in Gomez v. United States."
"for Indemnity. H. Economic Loss Doctrine Defendant argues that an essential element of each of Plaintiffs tort-based causes of action is an injury or damage proximately caused by Defendant’s tortious conduct. Defendant asserts that for each tort-based cause of action, the economic loss rule bars recovery because Plaintiff has not put forth evidence showing tangible, physical injury to the Wellfield. Under Ohio law, the economic loss rule “prevents recovery in tort of damages for purely economic losses. The well-established general rule is that a plaintiff who has suffered only economic loss due to another’s negligence has not been injured in a manner which is legally cognizable or compensable.” Ashtabula River Corp. Grp. II v. Conrail, Inc., 549 F.Supp.2d 981, 987 (N.D.Ohio 2008) (<HOLDING>). In other words, “indirect economic damages","Can Plaintiff recover damages for purely economic losses under Ohio law if there is no evidence of tangible, physical injury?","The issue at hand is whether Plaintiff can recover damages for purely economic losses without any evidence of tangible, physical injury. Under Ohio law, the economic loss doctrine bars recovery in tort for purely economic losses. The general rule is that a plaintiff who has only suffered economic loss due to another's negligence has not been legally injured and cannot be compensated. This means that in order to recover damages, Plaintiff would need to demonstrate tangible, physical injury caused by Defendant's tortious conduct. In the present case, Defendant argues that Plaintiff has not provided any evidence of such injury to the Wellfield. Therefore, based on the economic loss doctrine and the absence of tangible, physical injury, Plaintiff would not be able to recover damages for purely economic losses.","No, under the economic loss doctrine in Ohio law, Plaintiff cannot recover damages for purely economic losses without showing evidence of tangible, physical injury caused by Defendant's tortious conduct, as established in Ashtabula River Corp.

"fees. In short, all of Plaintiffs’ substantive claims are examples of bootstrapping. The Court must finally address Plaintiffs claim for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief. This count of the complaint fails to state a claim because after dismissal of the substantive claims there is no underlying legal action upon which to Plaintiff may receive declaratory or injunctive relief. It is well settled that an injunction is a remedy. A claim for injunctive relief does not stand alone, but requires a viable underlying legal claim. The same is true for declaratory relief, the source of which in federal court is the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. See Collin County, Texas v. Homeowners Assoc. for Values Essential to Neighborhoods, 915 F.2d 167, 170 (5th Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). B. The Motion for Severance and Motion to",Can Plaintiffs still pursue a claim for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief after their substantive claims have been dismissed?,"In this case, all of Plaintiffs' substantive claims have been dismissed as examples of bootstrapping. Therefore, there is no underlying legal action upon which Plaintiffs could seek declaratory or injunctive relief. It is well established that an injunction is a remedy that requires a viable underlying legal claim. Similarly, declaratory relief, which is granted under the Declaratory Judgment Act in federal court, also requires a legal claim to support it. The case of Collin County, Texas v. Homeowners Assoc. for Values Essential to Neighborhoods supports this reasoning by stating that declaratory relief cannot stand alone and needs an underlying legal claim.","No, Plaintiffs cannot pursue a claim for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief after their substantive claims have been dismissed, as stated by the court's reasoning and supported by the Collin County, Texas v.

"the level of persecution; 2) that the persecution was on account of one or more of the five protected grounds; and 3) that the persecution was committed either by the government or by forces that the government was unable or unwilling to control. Chand v. INS, 222 F.3d 1066, 1073 (9th Cir.2000).

INS, persecution is defined as the infliction of suffering or harm upon individuals who differ in race, religion, or political opinion, in a way considered offensive. Physical harm or beatings are not necessarily required for an act to be considered persecution. The case of Artiga Turcios v. INS supports this reasoning, as it established that threats and attacks alone can constitute persecution, even in the absence of physical harm.

"whether to order the prisoner’s removal in this category of cases, ‘it follows that such a case may proceed without attendance by the prisoner-parent.’ ” (In re Jesusa V., supra, 32 Cal.4th at p. 599.) Counsel could have rightly perceived that the court was not under a mandatory obligation to order father’s removal, and thus any objection to proceeding without him would have been futile. 2. Findmg of Intent to Abandon Under Section 7822 Father also contends the trial court erred because it could not terminate his parental rights without a finding of intent to abandon under section 7822. Father argues that, without this finding, there was no showing of parental unfitness as required by Adoption of Kelsey S. (1992) 1 Cal.4th 816, 849 [4 Cal.Rptr.2d 615, 823 P.2d 1216] (Kelsey S.)

On November 3, 1992, when Gilkey was 17, he was referred to the juvenile court for his third juvenile adjudication, for carrying a concealed weapon. A sentence of continued custody was imposed for this third adjudication. Gilkey remained in custody until April 8,1993. Gilkey concedes that his confinement constituted a “juvenile sentence to confinement” for purposes of § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). See Appellant Br. at 11; see also United States v.

In this case, Gilkey was referred to the juvenile court for these offenses when he was 14 years old and a sentence of probation with restitution was imposed.

It is important to note that Gilkey's confinement, after the revocation of probation, can be considered a ""juvenile sentence to confinement"" according to § 4A1.2(d)(2)(A). The United States v. Birch case supports this interpretation.

"that City bears the burden of demonstrating that the City Council’s decision is supported by substantial evidence. (See City Motion at 13; AirTouch Opp’n at 18.) The Court accepts that stipulation, and accordingly will assign the burden of proof in § 332(c)(7)(B)(iii) on the City. c.

There is a lack of consensus among jurisdictions, with no Ninth Circuit authority specifically addressing this issue. However, the Fourth Circuit in AT & T Wireless PCS v. City Council of Virginia Beach held that constituent testimony alone can be a basis for a telecommunications zoning decision. On the other hand, Cellular Telephone Co. v.

"allow [the Court] to depart downward.” The court then went on to consider the government’s motion for an upward departure, a motion the court granted. In the final analysis, despite the government’s attempts to paint them as innocuous, the district court’s comments are pointed and reflect a belief that the court lacked discretion to depart downward. This, however, is error. In effect, the district court inverted the rule. The district court appeared to assume that, absent the Guidelines’ express reference to a particular factor, the court lacked authority to depart downward on that basis; the rule, however, is the opposite — unless the Guidelines specifically proscribe consideration of the factor, then the factor is to be considered.

In Delaware, the use of prior convictions as evidence is governed by the ""fourfold"" analysis laid out in State v. Jones. The court in Williams v.

The U.S. Supreme Court in Old Chief v. United States established that if a prior conviction is admitted as evidence, the party offering it may be precluded from introducing evidence of the underlying facts of the conviction to avoid any undue prejudice. The Delaware Supreme Court in Jones v. State confirmed this principle. Numerous subsequent Delaware cases have cited and affirmed the application of the fourfold analysis.

In Florida, to establish self-defense, the defendant must show that the victim committed an overt act that reasonably indicated a need for action in self-defense. The defendant can lay the foundation for self-defense by introducing evidence of the victim's reputation or specific acts. The cases of Sanchez v. State and Hager v. State support this requirement. However, in the case of Molina v. State, the court concluded that the trial court erred by excluding testimony about the victim's reputation as a bully without showing that the defendant had knowledge of that reputation. Likewise, in Marcum v. State, it was held that the purpose of specific acts evidence is to establish the defendant's knowledge of the victim's violent tendencies. Therefore, if the exclusion of testimony regarding the victim's reputation or specific acts was crucial in this self-defense case, the trial court's decision may have been incorrect.","The trial court may have been incorrect in excluding testimony regarding the victim's reputation or specific acts in a self-defense case, as such evidence is crucial in establishing the defendant's knowledge of the victim's violent tendencies, as per the rulings in Sanchez v.

The Restaurant therefore attempted the other approach ad dressed in Mantas, that is, it filed a separate suit to resolve the settlement dispute and asked the appellate court to abate the appeal of the underlying cause pending that resolution. Our own precedent indicates that res judicata would not apply in these circumstances. See Wood v. Cosme, 447 S.W.2d 746, 750 (Tex. Civ. App.—Houston [14th Dist.] 1969, no writ) (<HOLDING>).

"that the evidence was not relevant, made no determination as to whether it was constitutionally impermissible. It was therefore incumbent on Perry, in objecting to the admission of evidence about her lack of remorse, to raise the issue of due process to the trial court in order to preserve this objection for direct appeal. AFFIRMED. HOWARD and BEATTY, JJ., concur. 1 . Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issue on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. 2 . Perry cites the following authorities in support of her argument: Doyle v.

The court in this case did not make a determination as to whether the evidence about Perry's lack of remorse was constitutionally impermissible, but rather focused on its relevance. Therefore, Perry should have specifically raised the issue of due process to the trial court in order to preserve this objection for direct appeal. The authorities cited by Perry, Doyle v. Ohio and State v. Reid, support the idea that references to a defendant's silence or lack of remorse can have constitutional implications, further emphasizing the importance of raising the due process issue to the trial court.","No, Perry did not raise the issue of due process to the trial court regarding the admission of evidence about her lack of remorse, as noted in the court's affirmation of the lower court's decision."
"be varied by legislative action. Id. As the Florida Supreme Court stated in Ammer-man: [T]the term may be defined in different statutes or for different purposes. See 73 C.J.S. Property s. 2, p. 152. For example, Fla. Stat., s. 421.03(12), F.S.A. defines ‘real property' for the purposes of the housing authorities law; Fla. Stat., s. 475.01(11), F.S.A. defines ‘real property’ for the purposes of the real estate license law; Fla. Stat., s. 713.01(14), F.S.A. defines ‘real property for the purposes of the mechanics lien law. These definitions vary, because the statutory definitions usually apply only to the term as used in the particular statutory provision. Id. (emphasis added). We have recognized this legal principle. Miami Country Day Sch. v. Bakst, 641 So.2d 467, 469 (Fla. 3d DCA 1994)(<HOLDING>). Applying this principle, the brothers argue","How is the term ""real property"" defined in Florida law and does it vary depending on the purpose it is used for?","The question at hand pertains to the definition of ""real property"" in the context of Florida law. The Florida Supreme Court's decision in Ammerman establishes that the term ""real property"" can have varying definitions within different statutes and for different purposes. The court specifically cites examples of how the definition of ""real property"" can differ in statutes relating to housing authorities, real estate licenses, and mechanics lien laws. These variations exist because the statutory definitions are typically specific to the particular provision they are related to. This legal principle has been acknowledged in previous cases such as Miami Country Day Sch. v. Bakst. Therefore, it can be concluded that the definition of ""real property"" can differ depending on the purpose it serves within a specific statute.","The term ""real property"" in Florida law can be defined differently depending on the purpose it is used for within a particular statute."
"t Den-ton’s argument that defendants decided to investigate the June 30, 2011, arrest, terminate his employment, and release the video to the Tulsa World in retaliation for the July 7, 2011, email he sent to his fellow union members. Denton also argues that because Owasso declined to impose any significant discipline against a group of police officers who engaged in similar conduct during the arrest of a suspect several years earlier, the harsher decisions made with regard to Denton must have been linked to his union activity when he sent the email. Although the Garcetti/Pickering analysis applies to an association based retaliation claim, a plaintiff need only satisfy the first, fourth, and fifth prongs of the test. See Shrum v. City of Coweta, 449 F.3d 1132, 1138-39 (10th Cir. 2006) (<HOLDING>).

In analyzing this claim, the court applies the Garcetti/Pickering analysis, which requires satisfying the first, fourth, and fifth prongs of the test. The Shrum v. City of Coweta case clarifies that these three prongs apply to association-based retaliation claims. Therefore, in order to establish retaliation, Denton needs to demonstrate that his email was a matter of public concern, that it was a motivating factor in the adverse actions taken against him, and that the defendants' actions were not justified by legitimate government interests.","To determine whether defendants terminated Denton's employment and released the video in retaliation for the email he sent to his fellow union members, the court will evaluate whether Denton's email was a matter of public concern, whether it played a role in the adverse actions taken against him, and whether the defendants' actions were justified by legitimate government interests."

"Opinion at 4-5. His fears are unfounded. First, the state action requirement, operating entirely apart from the standing requirement, would obviously screen out the vast majority of consumer-preference grievances, for a consumer aggrieved about the disappearance of his favorite brand would have to find a cause of action against a governmental body or face dismissal for failure to state a claim. In any event, of those claims that remain, the independent causation requirement of the standing requirement would bar the tenuous claims Judge Silberman fears from ever reaching the merits. Only those consumers who could prove that a ""substantial likelihood,” see Duke Power Co., 438 U.S. at 75 n. 20, 98 S.Ct. at 2631 n. 20, existed that the governmental 2232, 2241, 65 L.Ed.2d 184 (1980) (<HOLDING>); see also Autolog Corp. v. Regan, 731 F.2d 25,",Can consumers file a lawsuit against a governmental body for the disappearance of their favorite brand?,"The question pertains to the standing requirement and the state action requirement for consumer lawsuits against a governmental body. The state action requirement necessitates that a cause of action must be established against a governmental body for consumer grievances related to the disappearance of their favorite brand. This requirement acts independently of the standing requirement. Furthermore, the standing requirement includes an independent causation requirement, which would bar tenuous claims from proceeding to the merits. To reach the merits, consumers must provide evidence of a ""substantial likelihood"" that the governmental body played a substantial role in the disappearance of their favorite brand. Therefore, Judge Silberman's concerns about frivolous claims are unwarranted as both the state action and standing requirements act as safeguards against such claims.","Consumers cannot file a lawsuit against a governmental body for the disappearance of their favorite brand unless they can prove a ""substantial likelihood"" of the governmental body's significant involvement, as per the standing and state action requirements."
"HRS § 386-88 supersedes HRS § 91-14 and removes the circuit court from the appellate process with regard to the proceedings brought under HRS ch. 386”. Id. In DeVictoria v. H & K Contractors, 56 Haw. 552, 545 P.2d 692 (1976), the supreme court confirmed HRS § 91-14(b) provides that “proceedings for review shall be instituted in the circuit court ... except where a statute provides for a direct appeal to the supreme court."" DeVictoria, 56 Haw. at 556 n. 3, 545 P.2d at 697, n. 3 (emphasis added). Therefore, under Ras and DeVictoria, HRS chapter 91 applies except with respect to the circuit court provision. Thus, HRS § 91-14 concerning the standard of review on appeal governs in the present case. See Ostrowski v. Wasa Elec.

In the case at bar, the district court was not given sufficient opportunity to address the motion to intervene prior to the filing of the notice of appeal. Once such notice was filed, the district court was without jurisdiction to address the motion. Accordingly, the district court did not err in denying Lobasso’s motion to intervene. VII. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court’s order dismissing Taylor’s complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. In addition, we affirm the denial of Lobasso’s 54 (11th Cir.2001) (<HOLDING>). 3 . Taylor contends that there is a",Can the district court address the motion to intervene after the notice of appeal is filed?,"The question pertains to the jurisdiction of the district court to address the motion to intervene after the notice of appeal is filed.

Therefore, in the present case, the district court was correct in denying Lobasso's motion to intervene, as it did not have the authority to address the motion after the notice of appeal was filed. Furthermore, the absence of subject-matter jurisdiction was also established in Triax Co. v. TRW Inc., where the issue was not addressed.

Reviewing these allegations as a whole the Court finds that Zigman has sufficiently pled a single instance of mail fraud sufficient to support a RICO claim. See Altman, 48 F.3d at 103 (<HOLDING>). In paragraph A, Zigman alleges that the",Did Michael commit mail fraud by causing the mailing of an approved estimate and a check for repairs to a Mercedes Benz?,"Based on the allegations presented, Michael is accused of causing the mailing of an approved estimate and a check for repairs to a Mercedes Benz. This action falls under the purview of mail fraud. Mail fraud involves using the United States Postal Service or private mail carriers to carry out a scheme or artifice to defraud others of money or property. In this case, Michael's actions of causing the mailing of an approved estimate and a check for repairs to a Mercedes Benz appear to be part of a fraudulent scheme. These actions involve the use of the mails and potentially result in financial harm to the insurance company. Therefore, it can be concluded that Michael committed mail fraud in this instance.","Yes, Michael committed mail fraud by causing the mailing of an approved estimate and a check for repairs to a Mercedes Benz, which is in violation of the law."
"for discrimination or retaliation purposes between “termination” and other adverse actions such as “failure to promote” or “denial of transfer.” See Morgan, 536 U.S. at 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061. Nor does — or could— the majority ultimately hinge its decision on the absence of any formal “reinstatement process.” The denial of reinstatement can give rise to a claim if grounded in discriminatory or retaliatory bias, regardless of whether any formal process attends the denial. Indeed, one of the cases cited by the majority in setting out when reinstatement claims might be made, EEOC v. City of Norfolk Police Department, 45 F.3d 80 (4th Cir.1995) (cited ante, at 529-30), establishes that refusal of reinstatement through informal means can be actionable. See Norfolk Police, 45 F.3d at 84-85 (<HOLDING>). The majority ultimately rests its decision on",Can a claim for denial of reinstatement be made even if there is no formal reinstatement process in place?,"The question revolves around the denial of reinstatement and whether a claim can be made in the absence of a formal reinstatement process. In the case of Morgan v. National Railroad Passenger Corporation, the court clarified that other adverse actions such as failure to promote or denial of transfer can be considered as grounds for discrimination or retaliation, even if they are not categorized as ""termination."" Therefore, the absence of a formal reinstatement process does not preclude the possibility of a claim if the denial of reinstatement is motivated by discriminatory or retaliatory bias. In the EEOC v. City of Norfolk Police Department case, it was established that even the refusal of reinstatement through informal means can give rise to an actionable claim. Hence, the presence of a formal process is not a determining factor for the validity of a claim.","Yes, a claim for denial of reinstatement can be made even in the absence of a formal reinstatement process, as established in the case of Morgan v.

Here, the court reviewed and adopted the PSI, but then found that employment opportunities in prison and after release would enable McCorvey to pay a fine in the amount of $800. McCorvey has offered nothing to show his inability to pay this small amount. As the court noted, McCorvey is only 48 years old, has a college education, and has no medical conditions that would prevent him from being able to work while incarcerated and after release. Thus, it appears that the court sufficiently considered the necessary factors before imposing a fine. McCorvey has offered nothing other than the PSI’s findings of his outstanding debt as evidence of his Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). 4 . Rule 403 provides, ""[a]lthough relevant,",Can McCorvey claim his inability to pay the imposed fine based on his outstanding debt as evidence?,"The issue at hand is whether McCorvey can claim his inability to pay the imposed fine based on his outstanding debt as evidence.

In this case, the court reviewed and adopted the Pre-Sentence Investigation (PSI), which included McCorvey's outstanding debt, but then found that employment opportunities in prison and after release would enable McCorvey to pay the fine. The court considered relevant factors such as McCorvey's age, education, and medical conditions. McCorvey has not provided any evidence other than the PSI's findings of his outstanding debt to support his claim of inability to pay. Therefore, it can be argued that the court sufficiently considered the necessary factors before imposing the fine, and McCorvey's outstanding debt alone is not enough to prove his inability to pay.","No, McCorvey cannot claim his inability to pay the imposed fine based solely on his outstanding debt as evidence. The court in United States v. Rowland stated that the necessary factors must be considered to determine if the defendant is able to pay the fine.

On September 19, 2014, after additional state-court proceedings, Mr. Chase filed a second § 2254 application in federal district court again asserting ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his plea. He supported his argument with alleged new law—Lafler v. Cooper, — U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 1376, 182 L.Ed.2d 398 (2012). The district court dismissed the application for lack of jurisdiction and denied a COA, determining that the application was second or successive. The court declined to transfer the application to this court because Lafler did not announce a new rule of constitutional law and therefore it would not apply retroactively to Mr. Chase’s conviction. See In re Graham, 714 F.3d 1181, 1182-83 (10th Cir.2013) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>). Mr. Chase now seeks a COA from us. He asserts","Can Mr. Chase file a second § 2254 application in federal district court, claiming ineffective assistance of counsel based on alleged new law?","The question revolves around the filing of a second § 2254 application in federal district court. In this case, Mr. Chase filed a second application asserting ineffective assistance of counsel with respect to his plea. However, the district court dismissed the application for lack of jurisdiction based on it being second or successive. The court's decision was based on the fact that the alleged new law, Lafler v. Cooper, did not announce a new rule of constitutional law and therefore would not apply retroactively to Mr. Chase's conviction. This aligns with the ruling in In re Graham, where it was determined that Lafler did not create a new constitutional rule. Therefore, based on this reasoning, Mr. Chase may not be able to file a second § 2254 application in federal district court based on the alleged new law.","No, Mr. Chase may not be able to file a second § 2254 application in federal district court based on the alleged new law, as it does not announce a new rule of constitutional law and would not apply retroactively to his conviction, as determined in the case of In re Graham."

Suing state officials solely in their official capacities is equivalent to suing the State itself. This principle is supported by the case law in North Dakota, specifically Livingood v. Meece and N.D.C.C. § 32-12.2-03(1). The court in Livingood v. Meece established that when state employees are sued for actions taken in their official capacities, it is akin to suing the State itself. This means that for valid service of process, suing state officials in their official capacities follows the same rules as suing the State. Therefore, based on the legal precedent in North Dakota, it is clear that the plaintiff can sue state officials in their official capacities.","Yes, the plaintiff can sue state officials in their official capacities as it is equivalent to suing the State itself, as established in North Dakota case law, specifically Livingood v.

"does not apply so as to preclude a new evidentiary hearing on the enhancement issue, we have still found no basis in the record to conclude the initial hearing on this issue was inadequate. The State has pointed to no error in the district court proceeding that would entitle the State to a new hearing, nor does the record reveal any other matter that hindered the prosecution’s ability to amend the trial information prior to that hearing in order to rely on other prior convictions. In sum, the State had a full and fair opportunity to support its accusation that the defendant was a habitual offender, but its evidence was insufficient.

Additionally, there is no evidence in the record to suggest any hindrance to the prosecution's ability to amend the trial information prior to the initial hearing.

The question of whether a corporation is performing sufficient secondary or derivative government functions to be shielded from state taxation under M’Culloch v. Maryland, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 316 (1819) is a far different question from whether it is subject to a constitutional restriction against burdening 127, 1132 (9th Cir. 1994) (<HOLDING>).

City of Spokane, this alone does not resolve the issue at hand. The determination of whether a corporation is engaged in sufficient secondary or derivative government functions to qualify for protection against state taxation, as established in M'Culloch v.

"in the separation of church and state cannot substitute for requirement of injury in fact). Thus even if the crosses offend plaintiffs, that offense is insufficient to entitle them to maintain suit. Notwithstanding the insufficiency of psychological injury, the Supreme Court has held that the required injury need not be severe and need not be economic. An example of a non-economic injury which the Supreme Court has held confers standing is the deprivation of a citizen’s beneficial use of a public park. See United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), 412 U.S. 669, 686, 93 S.Ct. 2405, 2415, 37 L.Ed.2d 254 (1973) (claimed impediment to plaintiffs’ recreational use of natural resources is sufficient to confer standing).

Here,",Can the plaintiffs maintain a lawsuit against the presence of crosses if they are only offended by them but have not suffered any severe or economic injury?,"The question at hand involves whether the plaintiffs have standing to maintain a lawsuit against the presence of crosses. According to the Supreme Court, to have standing, the plaintiffs must demonstrate an injury in fact. While psychological offense alone is insufficient to establish standing, the Supreme Court has recognized that the required injury does not need to be severe or economic. In the case of United States v. Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP), it was established that the deprivation of a citizen's beneficial use of a public park was considered a non-economic injury that conferred standing. Therefore, if the presence of crosses in this case impedes the plaintiffs' use of the surrounding area or affects their recreational activities, it could be argued that they have suffered a non-economic injury, thus granting them standing to maintain the lawsuit.","Yes, if the presence of the crosses in the area has impeded the plaintiffs' use of the surrounding space or affected their recreational activities, they may maintain a lawsuit against the crosses, even if they have not suffered severe or economic injury.

Although the standard for liability may vary depending on the jurisdiction, it is generally based on the individual's capacity to appreciate danger. In cases where the mentally disabled person's mental capacity is diminished to the extent that they are totally unable to appreciate danger, then a subjective standard may apply. However, if the mental disability does not reach that level, a modified objective standard may be used. The Payne v.

Therefore, in analyzing the exclusive agency arrangement between Kaldi and Farmers, it is crucial to consider the plain language of the Agreement.

Second, the trial judge relied upon Dr.",What were the errors made by the circuit court in admitting Dr. DeYoub's report as evidence?,"The question revolves around the errors made by the circuit court in admitting Dr. DeYoub's report as evidence. Firstly, the report contained information based on interviews conducted by Dr. DeYoub with various individuals, including the appellant and her daughters. However, since Dr. DeYoub did not testify in court, it is impossible to determine which of his conclusions were based on his direct observations of the appellant and which were based on the statements of other persons.

Secondly, it is unclear whether the conclusions relied upon by the court were based on hearsay or double-hearsay, and if any exceptions to the hearsay rule applied, such as Rule 803(4) of the Arkansas Rules of Evidence.

Additionally, deductions from current monthly income may also be subject to distortions. For example, the means test assumes that secured debts will be paid in full, but this may not be realistic in practice. In cases where a debtor is not actually required to pay certain under-secured debts or has surrendered collateral, these deductions should not be included in the calculation. The In re Feller, In re Minahan, and In re Watson cases provide legal support for the understanding and application of these distortions in the means test.","The means test takes into account distortions in a debtor's disposable income calculation.

However, the court has dismissed the plaintiff's common law claims as untimely, and therefore the question of retaliation does not impact those claims. It is important to note that the court's decision on the plaintiff's compliance with the mandatory notice requirements of D.C. Code § 12-309 has no bearing on his constitutional claims. In order to determine whether the defendants' actions constituted retaliation, it would be necessary to analyze the specific circumstances and evidence surrounding the incidents and consider any relevant statutes and case law regarding retaliation.","Whether defendants' actions on February 13, 2004, constituted retaliation for the earlier incident where Plaintiff drove away from his home and caused Defendant Sloan to fall off the vehicle would require a thorough examination of the specific circumstances and evidence surrounding the incidents, as well as relevant statutes and case law on retaliation.

"the magistrate judge’s finding. Instead, the Millers argue that they are entitled to a less stringent standard because they are not attacking the validity of the foreclosure sale but, rather, are seeking only compensatory damages arising from the sale. The Millers are correct that the above three-part standard — in particular the requirement to show a grossly inadequate selling price — does not apply to all wrongful foreclosure claims* under Texas law. However, the cases on which the Millers rely establish only a particularized exception whereby the plaintiff-mortgagor may avoid showing a grossly inadequate selling price if he or she alleges that the defendant-mortgagee (lender) deliberately “chilled” the bidding at the foreclosure sale. See, e.g., Charter Nat’l Bank, 781 S.W.2d at 371 (<HOLDING>).

"threaten the employee-public servant. Similar pressure motivated by social issues likewise would not be covered by the proposed rule. As in the case of political pressure, I express no opinion on whether a clear mandate of public policy would cover that situation. The prospect of picketing in front of the employer’s place of business, threatening to withhold patronage, and other forms of economic pressure to effectuate the social goals of those protesting, should not be lightly dismissed. A rule prohibiting discharge might be totally ineffective: the protests and demonstrations would continue. Further, it might be unthinkable and perhaps unconstitutional to attempt to stop them. Cf.

"reasonable doubt “without regard” to the historical practice of juries. To the extent the district court repeated the prosecutor’s statement in sustaining the defendants’ objection, it was to illustrate that the district court’s instructions would render the prosecutor’s remark irrelevant.

Even assuming some residual prejudicial effect remained, the prosecutor’s statement did not affect Ortiz’s and Rolon’s substantial rights because — in light of the substantial independent evidence of their guilt — no reasonable probability exists that this statement altered the outcome of the trial.

"and third methods of proof under Russell lead to the same conclusion as the first method of proof: that the employee is unable to work in any capacity.

However, the second and third methods focus on the vocational component of disability and consider an employee totally disabled if they are medically capable of working but unable to secure employment. This is supported by the cases of White and Bridwell, where the courts upheld awards of total disability for a closed period based on the finding that the employee made unsuccessful efforts to find suitable work.

The courts are reluctant to consider contracts void based on public policy unless their illegality is clear and certain, and it is evident that they violate the public policy of the state. This principle aims to preserve the enforceability of contracts, and the courts will not easily deem an agreement void on the grounds of public policy unless it is unequivocally in violation. Thus, a contract cannot be declared void based on public policy in Alabama unless it indisputably violates the state's public policy. This reasoning is supported by the Terry Cove North, Inc. v.

If a contractor has in good faith substantially performed a building contract, they are permitted to sue under the contract, as substantial performance is treated as equivalent to full performance for the condition precedent to the right of recovery.

Sanbria-Bueno was convicted under 21 U.S.C. § 846 for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841. Nevertheless, Sanbria-Bueno contends that the offense was not categorically a “drug trafficking offense” within the meaning of § 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because a generic conspiracy requires an overt act while § 846 does not. See United States v. Shabani, 513 U.S. 10, 17, 115 S.Ct. 382, 130 L.Ed.2d 225 (1994) (<HOLDING>).

In determining whether an offense falls under this category, courts typically analyze the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense. The Supreme Court in United States v. Taylor held that courts should use the categorical approach, looking to the elements of the offense rather than the specific conduct of the defendant. However, Sanbria-Bueno argues that the offense of conspiracy under § 846 does not categorically qualify as a ""drug trafficking offense"" because it does not require an overt act, unlike a generic conspiracy. In United States v. Shabani, the Supreme Court held that a generic conspiracy does require an overt act. Based on this interpretation of the law, Sanbria-Bueno contends that the offense should not be considered a ""drug trafficking offense"" for the purposes of § 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i).","The court determines whether an offense qualifies as a ""drug trafficking offense"" under § 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) by applying the categorical approach.

In the case of a conviction under 21 U.S.C. § 846 for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute heroin, the question arises as to whether this offense qualifies as a ""drug trafficking offense."" Sanbria-Bueno argues that it does not because a generic conspiracy requires an overt act, while § 846 does not. This argument is supported by the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Shabani. Therefore, it remains to be determined whether this offense meets the criteria of a ""drug trafficking offense"" under § 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) of the United States Code."
"statistics but also all the surrounding facts and circumstances”); Police Officers for Equal Rights v. City of Columbus, 644 F.Supp. 393, 432 n. 13 (S.D.Ohio 1985) (stating that even if plaintiff fell short of cut-offs for statistical significance, “other evidence submitted in this case ... tends to support the inference of disparate impact suggested by plaintiffs statistical data”). The Plaintiffs bolster their evidence on statistical significance by presenting evidence that the 2005 and 2008 exams violated the four-fifths rule. As this Court has already held, “a violation of the four-fifths rule ... may demonstrate adverse impact, particularly when coupled with other statistical evidence of adverse impact.” Cotter, 193 F.Supp.2d at 348 n. 12; see also Bradley, 443 F.Supp.2d at 163 (<HOLDING>).

The court in Cotter v. City of Columbus and Bradley v. [Unknown] has already established that a violation of the four-fifths rule can serve as evidence of adverse impact, especially when coupled with other statistical evidence. The four-fifths rule states that if the selection rate for a protected group is less than four-fifths or 80% of the selection rate for the group with the highest selection rate, it indicates adverse impact. This demonstrates that the violation of the four-fifths rule can be significant in determining adverse impact in the case of the 2005 and 2008 exams, supporting the plaintiffs' arguments.","Yes, the violation of the four-fifths rule can demonstrate adverse impact in the case of the 2005 and 2008 exams, as established in the Cotter v.

According to the case of Local Union 1111, United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v. Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation, the Sixth Circuit held that federal jurisdiction under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act is limited to parties that are signatories to the contract being sued upon. The court emphasized that the intention of section 301 is to create federal jurisdiction only over parties to the specific contract being sued upon. Similarly, in the case of Service, Hospital, Nursing Home, and Public Employees Union v. Commercial Property Services, Inc., the court held that a district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement if no rights or duties are stated in the terms and conditions of the agreement. In both cases, the plaintiffs sought to recover against non-signatories to the collective bargaining agreements, but the courts ruled in favor of limited subject matter jurisdiction. Therefore, in the context of this question, if no rights or duties are specified in the terms and conditions of the collective bargaining agreement, a district court would not have subject matter jurisdiction over a non-signatory to the agreement.","No, a district court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over a non-signatory to a collective bargaining agreement if no rights or duties are stated in the terms and conditions of the agreement, as established in the cases of Local Union 1111, United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO v.

"by an attorney in the family court, as were these parties) who is dissatisfied with the outcome of a child custody battle knows that there is very little likelihood that a family court will change its decision when reminded of its obligation to make specific findings, and few will pursue that route if not required to do so before seeking appellate review. Instead, this opinion permits a litigant who loses in the trial court to simply appeal and try to secure a more favorable outcome before a different judge when the child custody determination is inevitably vacated and the case remanded. At a time when the Arizona Supreme Court has recently limited the use of this type of litigation tactic in criminal cases, see State v. Henderson, 210 Ariz. 561, 567, ¶ 19, 115 P.3d 601, 607 (2005) (<HOLDING>), we should not expand its use in civil cases.",What is the likelihood of a family court changing its decision in a child custody battle when reminded of its obligation to make specific findings?,"In this context, the issue pertains to the likelihood of a family court changing its decision in a child custody battle when specific findings are brought to its attention. The passage suggests that there is a minimal likelihood that a family court will change its decision when reminded of its obligation to make specific findings. It further indicates that litigants are unlikely to pursue this route unless specifically required to do so before seeking appellate review. The passage highlights that losing parties often appeal and attempt to obtain a more favorable outcome from a different judge when the child custody determination is eventually vacated and remanded. This tactic of seeking a different outcome before a different judge is discouraged, as it expands the use of litigation tactics that have been limited in criminal cases by the Arizona Supreme Court. Therefore, based on these considerations, it can be inferred that there is a low likelihood of a family court changing its decision when reminded of its obligation to make specific findings in a child custody battle.","There is a minimal likelihood of a family court changing its decision in a child custody battle when reminded of its obligation to make specific findings, as indicated in the passage."

This decision applies to Mr. Belhomme's case as well. Furthermore, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, which allows for claims under federal law, does not apply to actions by the federal government, but rather to state and local entities. As established in Wheeldin v.

"of alimony, maintenance, or support.” The argument is unpersuasive as an initial matter because nothing in the language of section 523(a)(5) indicates that the dis-chargeability of an obligation turns on state laws regulating alimony and support. Had Congress intended. state law to be determinative, it likely would have stated that intent expressly. See Harrell, 754 F.2d at 904 (“If Congress had intended dischargeability to be determined by whether an obligation could be imposed under state law, it might have addressed dischargeability in those terms.”). In fact, as indicated above, the legislative history of section 523(a)(5) demonstrates that Congress determined that state support laws should not be determinative of whether a particular obligation is dischargeable. Cf. id. at 905 (<HOLDING>); Shaver, 736 F.2d at 1315-17 (holding that a",Does the dischargeability of an obligation under section 523(a)(5) depend on state laws regulating alimony and support?,"The question pertains to the dischargeability of an obligation under section 523(a)(5) and its relation to state laws.

Section 523(a)(5) does not indicate that the dischargeability depends on state laws regulating alimony and support, and if Congress intended for state law to be determinative, it would have stated so explicitly. The legislative history of section 523(a)(5) establishes that Congress did not intend for state support laws to dictate the dischargeability of an obligation. Previous court decisions, such as Harrell and Shaver, support this interpretation.

"recreational facilities ***.” (Emphasis added.) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1987, ch. 85, par. 3 — 106.) Section 3 — 106 applies to situations where a municipality fails to maintain property under its control intended for recreational use by allowing an unsafe condition to exist. Section 3 — 106, unlike section 3— 102, contemplates liability only if the governmental unit or employee acts in a willful and wanton manner. Pursuant to section 3— 106, there is no municipal liability for negligence resulting in injuries occurring on public property intended for recreational purposes, unless the local public entity is guilty of willful and wanton conduct. Burdinie v. Village of Glendale Heights (1990), 139 Ill. 2d 501. Accord Jarvis v. Herrin City Park District (1972), 6 Ill. App. 3d 516, 285 N.E.2d 564 (<HOLDING>). Plaintiff first argues that defendant has no","If a municipality fails to maintain property intended for recreational use and an unsafe condition exists, can the municipality be held liable for negligence resulting in injuries occurring on public property intended for recreational purposes?","The question revolves around the liability of a municipality in maintaining property intended for recreational purposes. Section 3 - 106 of the Illinois Revised Statutes establishes that a municipality can be held liable if it fails to maintain the property and allows an unsafe condition to exist, but only if the municipality or its employee acts in a willful and wanton manner. This means that negligence alone does not make the municipality liable for injuries on public recreational property. The Burdinie v. Village of Glendale Heights case reinforces this interpretation. Therefore, plaintiff's argument that the defendant has no liability for negligence on public recreational property is valid in light of the statutory provision and case law.","No, a municipality cannot be held liable for negligence resulting in injuries occurring on public property intended for recreational purposes, unless the municipality or its employee acted in a willful and wanton manner, as established by Section 3 - 106 of the Illinois Revised Statutes and the Burdinie v.

E.I. DuPont De Nemours & Co. case highlights that even when the circumstances giving rise to the actions are identical, dismissal is not mandated solely based on similarity. It is important to consider that in Ms. Madanes' action, there are ten defendants named, whereas the Swiss action only involves Pablo as the defendant. Furthermore, the activity in question in this action, such as the allegations of fraudulent transfers from the New York Account, is not part of the Swiss complaint.

"a court to examine the circumstances surrounding an assertion of lawful authority to search to determine whether the consent was sufficiently independent of the assertion to remove its taint. If not, the consent was not freely and voluntarily given. ¶ 18 Although it might be difficult to prove that consent given after an assertion of lawful authority to search was nevertheless freely given, we should not preclude the possibility that it could happen. For example, consent conceivably could be voluntary if, after an officer asserts lawful authority to search, the officer retracts that assertion or an attorney advises that the search is not lawfully required before the subject of the search consents. See Kunzler v. Pima Cty. Superior Court, 154 Ariz. 568, 570, 744 P.2d 669, 671 (1987) (<HOLDING>); State v.

If the consent is sufficiently independent of the assertion of lawful authority, it may remove any taint and be deemed freely given. While it may be challenging to prove that consent given after the assertion of lawful authority was still voluntary, it is not impossible. For instance, if the officer retracts their assertion of lawful authority or if an attorney advises that the search is not legally required before the person consents, it is conceivable that the consent could be deemed voluntary. The cases of Kunzler v. Pima Cty. Superior Court and State v.

"— the “subject to” language. In giving deference to the Secretary’s position, the Court held: The Secretary’s approach rejects a wooden requirement of actual deductions, but in their absence it requires a clear and particularized policy — one which “effectively communicates” that deductions will be made under specified circumstances.

The underlying nature of Multi-County’s contract claim is not altered simply because it seeks to prevent the governmental entities from continuing the alleged breach of contract in the future rather than seeking monetary damages for a breach that may have occurred in the past. In sum, this is a contract action to which governmental immunity applies. See, e.g., Dodgen, 158 Tex. at 79, 308 S.W.2d at 840-41 (<HOLDING>); Anderson v.

The cases of W.D. Haden Co. v. Dodgen and Anderson v. City of McKinney establish that governmental immunity applies to contract actions, without distinguishing between individual defendants and agency defendants. The fact that Multi-County seeks to prevent ongoing breaches rather than seeking monetary damages for past breaches does not alter the underlying nature of the contract claim.

If that is the case, proper service according to § 1132(e)(2) will always establish personal jurisdiction, because the defendant must be in the United States to be properly served under § 1132(e)(2). See Reimer Express, 230 F.3d at 941 (""The RICO and ERISA service of process provisions state that service may be made in 'any district,’ which indicates that Congress authorized service only in the judicial districts of the United States and not world-wide.”); see also Stauffacher v.

This means that if a defendant is properly served within the United States, it will always establish personal jurisdiction because the defendant must be in the United States to be served according to § 1132(e)(2). The Reimer Express case further supports this reasoning by stating that service of process provisions in RICO and ERISA authorize service only in the judicial districts of the United States, indicating that service is not allowed worldwide. Therefore, if a defendant is served within the United States, it establishes personal jurisdiction over them, as affirmed in the Stauffacher v. Bennett case.","Yes, if a defendant is served within the United States, it establishes personal jurisdiction over them, as affirmed in the Lorelei Corp. v. County of Guadalupe and Stauffacher v.

"traffic stop should have concluded. Accordingly, Clayborn asserts that Detective Hall could not ask for his license and registration because it was not reasonably related to the circumstances that justified the traffic stop. We disagree. On appeal from a district court’s denial of a motion to suppress evidence, this court reviews, the factual findings for clear error and the question of whether a Fourth Amendment violation occurred de novo. United States v. Allegree, 175 F.3d 648, 650 (8th Cir.1999). Clayborn does not challenge the factual finding that Detective Hall’s traffic stop was justified and lawful, because it was based on an objectively reasonable, although mistaken, belief that a traffic violation had occurred. See United States v. Peltier, 217 F.3d 608, 610 (8th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, the issue is whether the","Can Detective Hall ask for Clayborn's license and registration during a traffic stop, even if it is not directly related to the circumstances that justified the traffic stop?","The question pertains to whether Detective Hall had the right to ask for Clayborn's license and registration during the traffic stop, regardless of its direct relevance to the circumstances that justified the stop. In the case of United States v. Allegree, the court follows a de novo review process when determining if a Fourth Amendment violation occurred. It is established that Detective Hall's traffic stop was justified and lawful, as it was based on an objectively reasonable but mistaken belief that a traffic violation had taken place. Therefore, the key issue becomes whether the request for Clayborn's license and registration during the stop was within the bounds of the law. Although Clayborn argues that it was not reasonably related to the circumstances of the stop, our disagreement arises from the fact that during a routine traffic stop, it is standard procedure for an officer to ask for the license and registration of the driver. This practice aids in confirming the identity of the driver and ensuring compliance with traffic laws. Thus, Detective Hall's request for Clayborn's license and registration was within the scope of his authority and did not violate the Fourth Amendment.","Yes, Detective Hall had the right to ask for Clayborn's license and registration during the traffic stop, even if it was not directly related to the circumstances that justified the stop. The request for the license and registration is standard procedure during a routine traffic stop, serving the purpose of confirming the driver's identity and ensuring compliance with traffic laws."

Moreover, numerous cases have applied the defalcation exception to debts owed by corporate officers, notwithstanding the absence of any express trust. See, e.g., Pepper v.

The district court’s view that only the",Can the defalcation exception be applied to debts owed by corporate officers?,"The question pertains to whether the defalcation exception can be applied to debts owed by corporate officers. The defalcation exception allows for the discharge of debts in bankruptcy, except for those incurred through fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity. The courts have applied the defalcation exception to debts owed by corporate officers, even in the absence of an express trust. According to the Pepper v. Litton case, directors and controlling stockholders are considered fiduciaries, and their powers are held in trust. Additionally, cases such as In re Hammond and In re Bernard have established that directors can be considered fiduciaries. Therefore, it can be argued that the defalcation exception can be applied to debts owed by corporate officers.","Yes, the defalcation exception can be applied to debts owed by corporate officers, as established in cases like Pepper v.

This means that it cannot be applied to properties that, in 1859, did not surpass the value prescribed by the 1876 constitution's enlarged exemption, without considering their value in 1877. This view is further supported by previous cases such as Wright v. Straub and McLane v. Paschal. Additionally, the Dallas Power & Light Co. v. Loomis case underlines this principle. Both federal and district court cases, In re Niland and In re Starns, respectively, have acknowledged that the earlier amendments were not retroactive until the passage of Tex. Prop.

"party responsible” therefore turns on which one of the two men was found more credible. This court, in reviewing administrative decisions both in and outside of the labor context, has consistently accorded substantial deference to the credibility determinations of the ALJ.

In cases both within and outside the labor context, the court has consistently accorded substantial deference to the credibility determinations made by the ALJ. This deference is based on the principle that the ALJ is in the best position to assess the credibility of witnesses and make determinations in light of conflicting testimony. Previous cases such as NLRB v. Taylor Mach. Prods., Inc. and Warner v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec. demonstrate the court's willingness to defer to the credibility determinations made by the ALJ. Therefore, it is unlikely that these determinations would be overturned unless there is clear error or an abuse of discretion.","Generally, the credibility determinations made by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) are given substantial deference and will not be overturned unless there is clear error or an abuse of discretion."
"“repeatedly told courts ... not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.” Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd, - U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2074, 2084, 179 L.Ed.2d 1149 (2011). We are aware of no case that would preclude a reasonable officer from believing there was probable cause to detain a person who alluded to committing suicide. Cf. Stoot v. City of Everett, 582 F.3d 910, 922 (9th Cir.2009) (granting qualified immunity where plaintiffs did not cite “a single case squarely holding that an officer cannot rely” on a particular victim’s statements in making an arrest); F.E. Trotter v. Watkins, 869 F.2d 1312, 1316 (9th Cir.1989) (finding that a violation could not be clearly established where no case had held so previously); see also Bias v. Moynihan, 508 F.3d 1212, 1220 (9th Cir.2007) (<HOLDING>). While the dissent discounts Hall’s statement",Can a reasonable officer believe there was probable cause to detain a person who alluded to committing suicide?,"The question pertains to whether a reasonable officer can detain a person who alludes to committing suicide. In the case of Ashcroft v. Al-Kidd, the court emphasized that clearly established law should not be defined at a high level of generality. Therefore, there is no precedent that explicitly precludes a reasonable officer from believing there was probable cause to detain a person in this situation. The Stoot v. City of Everett case granted qualified immunity to an officer because there was no specific case holding that an officer cannot rely on a particular victim's statements for an arrest. Similarly, in F.E. Trotter v. Watkins, a violation could not be deemed clearly established as there was no previous case holding so. Considering these precedents, along with the absence of a case specifically addressing this issue, a reasonable officer could believe that there was probable cause to detain a person who alluded to committing suicide.","Yes, a reasonable officer can believe there was probable cause to detain a person who alludes to committing suicide based on the absence of a specific case law and the guidance provided by the cases Ashcroft v.

The court in Cox v. Brookshire Grocery Co. established that if an employer fails to demonstrate good faith in actively endeavoring to ensure compliance with the FLSA, an award of liquidated damages becomes obligatory, regardless of the employer's willfulness. Similarly, in Alvarez v. IBP, Inc., the court ruled that post facto explanations by the employer for not taking affirmative steps to ensure compliance are inadequate to establish good faith. The case of First Citizens further supports this argument. Therefore, even if an employer can prove that they did not act willfully, if they failed to actively ensure compliance with the FLSA, they would still be liable for mandatory liquidated damages.","No, an employer cannot avoid mandatory liquidated damages under the FLSA if they can demonstrate that they did not act willfully but failed to actively ensure compliance with the law, as established by the court in Cox v.

Nevertheless, the court entered judgment against Hogan in the amount of $111,422.50. Hogan correctly argues that the lower court erred in entering a final default judgment against him where the complaint failed to allege any allegations against him, much less allege a cause of action. In Becerra v. Equity Imports, Inc., 551 So.2d 486 (Fla. 3d DCA 1989), the court held that the failure to state a cause of action is a fatal pleading deficiency not curable by a default judgment.

The New York Convention allows for the refusal of enforcement in such cases. Article V, § (l)(d) of the New York Convention provides grounds for refusing enforcement when the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the parties' agreement. In order to determine whether the procedure used was contrary to the agreed arbitral procedures, the court must examine the language of the parties' arbitration agreement. Relevant case law, such as Encyclopaedia Universalis S.A. v. Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. and Coast Trading Co. v. Pac. Molasses Co., supports this approach. Therefore, if it is established that the arbitral procedure deviated from the agreed-upon procedures, enforcement of the arbitral award may be declined.","Yes, an arbitral award can be declined enforcement if the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties, as provided by Article V, § (l)(d) of the New York Convention.

"rights, feasibly creating a barricade across Maryland’s shoreline. In the words of the Thomas Court, “such [a] consequence surely ought not to be desired by anyone.” Thomas, 63 Md. at 355. This conclusion is consistent with the pronouncements in other states regarding the character of the beaches at issue in those cases. Town of Manchester v. Augusta Country Club, 477 A.2d 1124, 1130 (Me.1984) (applying a rebuttable presumption of permissive use to a lakefront beach, as “wild and uncultivated land”); Spiegle v.

As noted, supra, “[a]s a general rule,",Can the owner of a beachfront property in Maryland legally restrict public access to the beach?,"The question pertains to the issue of public access to beachfront property in Maryland. According to the Thomas Court, the consequence of creating a barricade across Maryland's shoreline, thereby restricting public access, is not desirable. This perspective aligns with similar cases in other states. In Town of Manchester v. Augusta Country Club, the court applied a rebuttable presumption of permissive use to a lakefront beach, considering it as ""wild and uncultivated land"". Spiegle v. Beach Haven noted that the ocean front beach in question was unimproved and in a general state of nature. State ex rel. Shorett v. Blue Ridge Club further supports the idea that public access to such uncultivated land is generally allowed. As there is a precedent for preserving public access to beachfront property, it is likely that the owner of a beachfront property in Maryland cannot legally restrict public access to the beach, unless there are specific circumstances that warrant it.","No, the owner of a beachfront property in Maryland cannot legally restrict public access to the beach, as it is generally considered that public access to such uncultivated land should be allowed, as supported by legal precedents in other states."

Even if the dissent were correct in noting that the trial court “was well informed as to the detail and extent of Beckley’s perverse conduct,” infra ¶ 36, that is not the question.

"magnified in the prison context. Jolly, 923 F.Supp. at 949. Thus, Kassen held that where prison physicians exercise governmental discretion, they are entitled to official immunity. Id. at 949-50; Kassen, 887 S.W.2d at 10-11. On the other hand, the court concluded that where state-employed physicians exercise purely medical discretion (as in the diagnosis and treatment of patients), the purpose of official immunity no longer applies. See Kassen, 887 S.W.2d at 10-11. A physician’s exercise of purely medical discretion thus does not warrant official immunity. In 2003, the Texas Legislature superseded Kassen by extending official immunity to all employees acting within the scope of their employment. Tex. Civ. Prac. & Rem.

"NEPA challenge. E.

"1997) (unpublished disposition). The Court does not find those factual findings to be clearly erroneous. Therefore, the Court concludes that even if the letter had created a binding contract, Telelect was free to withdraw from the agreement given Baker’s inadequate performance. The Bankruptcy Court also considered whether the statements of policy published by Telelect and sent to Baker created a valid and binding contract under Virginia law. The trial court held that Telelect’s decision to send a copy of its statement of policy to Baker could imply a promise to abide by the terms of the statement as consideration for the distributor’s services.

In the case of In re JGB Industries, the trial court held that the act of sending the statement of policy to the distributor could imply a promise to adhere to its terms as consideration for the distributor's services. This finding was based on the precedent set in Thompson v. American Motor Inns, Inc., which supports the notion that such actions can create a contractual obligation. Thus, if a distributor receives a copy of a statement of policy from the party with whom they entered into an agreement, it can be inferred that compliance with the terms of the policy is an implied promise.","Yes, under Virginia law, sending a copy of a statement of policy to a distributor can imply a promise to abide by the terms of the statement as consideration for the distributor's services, as established in the In re JGB Industries case."

If Kinman’s opposition to the idea of being gay was as strong as she alleges, it is possible that any advances by a member of her own sex would have indeed been unwelcome. Furthermore, as the Supreme Court noted in Meritor Savings Bank, the relevant question is not whether Kinman voluntarily participated in sexual relations, but rather whether the advances were unwelcome. 477 U.S. at 68, 106 S.Ct. at 2406. To distinguish between an actual desire for a relationship on one hand, and a mere acquiescence to tendered sexual advances on the other, it is necessary to consider the power disparity be 830 F.Supp. 1288, 1297 (N.D.Cal.1993) (<HOLDING>) and Rowinsky v.

In Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, the Supreme Court established that the key factor in determining whether sexual advances were unwelcome is not the individual's voluntary participation in sexual relations, but rather the subjective feeling of unwelcome. If Kin-man strongly opposed the idea of being gay to the extent that it caused her to attempt suicide, it is plausible that advances from a same-sex individual would indeed be unwelcome. Additionally, in the case of Doe v. City of San Diego, the court recognized that power disparities must be taken into consideration when discerning between a genuine desire for a relationship versus a mere acquiescence to sexual advances. Therefore, the voluntary participation in sexual relations is not determinative, and the focus should be on whether the advances were unwelcome.","No, it is not relevant whether Kin-man voluntarily participated in sexual relations. The key consideration is whether the advances made by a member of the same sex were unwelcome, as established in the Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson case. Kin-man's opposition to the idea of being gay and her alleged distress suggest that any advances from a same-sex individual would likely be unwelcome, regardless of her voluntary participation in sexual relations.

"Willis, 98 N.M. 771, 773, 652 P.2d 1222, 1224 (Ct.App.1982), illustrates the point. In Willis, we held that an unborn viable fetus is not a “human being” within the meaning of the vehicular homicide statute.

In the Willis case, the court concluded that, in the absence of specific statutory provisions, an unborn viable fetus should not be included in the definition of a human being. The court reasoned that if the legislature intended to include viable fetuses in the definition, they would have done so explicitly. Subsequent statutes, such as NMSA 1978, § 30-3-7, further support the distinction between an unborn viable fetus and a human being. Therefore, based on the Willis case and subsequent legislative actions, an unborn viable fetus is not considered a ""human being"" under the vehicular homicide statute in New Mexico.","No, an unborn viable fetus is not considered a ""human being"" under the vehicular homicide statute in New Mexico, as established in the Willis case and subsequent legislation."
"a credit on any amount previously paid the employee pursuant to G.S. § 97-61.5. Further, the remaining provisions of G.S. § 97-61.5 providing for loss of other benefits “if the employee thereafter engages in any occupation which exposes him to the hazards of asbestosis or silicosis without having obtained the written approval of the Industrial Commission as provided in G.S. 97-61.7” must still apply. Under any other interpretation, a plaintiff whose lung impairment is due to silicosis or asbestosis, rather than another occupational lung disease, would be denied access to potential compensation provided by G.S. § 97-31(24), a result which appears to us to be patently unfair and possibly constitutionally infirm. See, e.g., Walters v. Blair, 120 N.C. App. 398, 462 S.E.2d 232 (1995) (<HOLDING>). By a separate assignment of error, plaintiff","Can a plaintiff be denied compensation under G.S. § 97-31(24) if their lung impairment is due to silicosis or asbestosis, even if they obtain the written approval of the Industrial Commission?","The question pertains to the denial of compensation under G.S. § 97-31(24) for plaintiffs with lung impairment caused by silicosis or asbestosis.

If the remaining provisions of G.S. § 97-61.5, which provide for loss of other benefits if the employee engages in an occupation exposing them to the hazards of asbestosis or silicosis without written approval, were not applicable, it would exclude plaintiffs with silicosis or asbestosis from potential compensation.

Therefore, obtaining the written approval of the Industrial Commission does not eliminate the potential compensation under G.S. § 97-31(24) for plaintiffs with lung impairment caused by silicosis or asbestosis.","No, obtaining written approval from the Industrial Commission does not eliminate the possibility of compensation under G.S. § 97-31(24) for plaintiffs with lung impairment due to silicosis or asbestosis, as established in Walters v.

The court's reasoning was that the prison environment is inherently restrictive and intrusive, and therefore, the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures does not apply to cell searches. The court specifically noted that the search of a cell is distinct from the search of an individual. So, based on the Hudson v. Palmer ruling, it can be concluded that a prison inmate's protected privacy rights do not extend to their bodies during a cell search.","No, a prison inmate's protected privacy rights do not extend to their bodies during a cell search, as established by the Supreme Court case of Hudson v.

The question of whether Mazique’s girlfriend consented to the search of the home was an issue for the court, not the jury. Thus, although the comment was improper, we find it was not prejudicial to Mazique. Also, the value of the stolen cigarettes was not an element of the crime or vital to the evidence in the case; thus, the comment was not prejudicial to Mazique. We further find the solicitor’s brief comments do not rise to “extraordinary circumstances” that would excuse the failure to make a contemporaneous objection. See Toyota of Florence, Inc. v.

See also Otwell, 733 So.2d at 953 (recognizing that there is no requirement under the plain-view doctrine that the officer come upon the evidence inadvertently). Here, there is no dispute that Cpl. Wells lawfully stopped Moore for running a stop sign. See Perry, 66 So.3d at 294 (explaining the law-enforcement officers may lawfully stop the driver of a vehicle for a traffic violation). Once Moore was lawfully stopped, Cpl. Wells properly ordered him to get out of the vehicle. See Mimms, 434 U.S. at 111 (<HOLDING>); Perry, 66 So.3d at 294 (same). After Moore",Can a law enforcement officer legally search a vehicle without a warrant if they see evidence of wrongdoing in plain view?,"The question pertains to the legality of a warrantless search of a vehicle based on the plain view doctrine. The plain view doctrine allows law enforcement officers to seize evidence without a warrant if they are lawfully present at the location and immediately recognize the object as evidence of wrongdoing. In the case of State v. Otwell, it was established that there is no requirement for the officer to come upon the evidence inadvertently. Here, it is undisputed that Cpl. Wells lawfully stopped Moore for running a stop sign, which gave him the authority to make contact with Moore. According to the holding in Mimms and Perry, once Moore was lawfully stopped, Cpl. Wells had the right to order him to get out of the vehicle. If, during this process, Cpl. Wells observed evidence of wrongdoing in plain view, he would be allowed to seize it without a warrant.","Yes, a law enforcement officer can legally search a vehicle without a warrant if they see evidence of wrongdoing in plain view, as established in the case of State v.

"and the creditor is free to foreclose upon the case’s conclusion without violating the discharge injunction. Johnson, 501 U.S. at 84, 111 S.Ct. 2150 (“[A] bankruptcy discharge extinguishes only one mode of enforcing a claim-namely, an action against the debtor in personam— while leaving intact another — namely, an action against the debtor in rem.”). Any deficiency that remains after the creditor forecloses on its liens and sells the property continues to exist, but is an uncollectible debt. Thus, following the discharge, the debt becomes nonrecourse debt.

The court respectfully declines to reach the",Can a creditor foreclose on a property even after the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy?,"The question concerns the ability of a creditor to foreclose on a property after the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy. In the case of Johnson v. Home State Bank, the Supreme Court held that a bankruptcy discharge only eliminates the debtor's personal liability for the debt, but does not affect the creditor's ability to enforce the debt against the property itself. This means that the creditor can still foreclose on the property and sell it to satisfy the debt, even after the debtor has received a discharge. The discharge simply converts the debt into a nonrecourse debt, meaning that any deficiency remaining after the foreclosure becomes uncollectible. Therefore, the creditor can pursue foreclosure without violating the discharge injunction.","Yes, a creditor can foreclose on a property even after the debt has been discharged in bankruptcy, as established in the case of Johnson v. Home State Bank. The discharge only eliminates the debtor's personal liability for the debt, but the creditor can still enforce the debt through foreclosure and sell the property to satisfy the debt. The remaining deficiency becomes a nonrecourse debt, which is uncollectible."
"Offender Act provides that, under certain circumstances, “the court may, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the defendant: (1) [djefer further proceeding and place the defendant on probation as provided by law; or (2) [sentence the defendant to a term of confinement as provided by law.” OCGA § 42-8-60 (a). Here, Kaylor was initially sentenced under the First Offender Act to fifteen years confinement, with the first four years to be served in confinement and the balance to be served on probation. Kaylor’s claim that the “explicit language of OCGA § 42-8-60 (a) allows for either probation or confinement, but not both, has already been decided adversely to [him].” (Punctuation and footnote omitted.) Mason u. State, 310 Ga. App. 118, 119 (1) (712 SE2d 76) (2011) (<HOLDING>). This is because the First Offender Act",Can a defendant be sentenced to both probation and confinement under the First Offender Act?,"The question pertains to the possibility of sentencing a defendant to both probation and confinement under the First Offender Act. According to OCGA § 42-8-60 (a), the court has the discretion to either place the defendant on probation or sentence them to confinement, but not both. This interpretation has been settled in the case of Mason v. State, where it was held that the explicit language of the statute does not allow for simultaneous imposition of both probation and confinement under the First Offender Act. Therefore, Kaylor's argument challenging this interpretation has already been decided adversely to him.","No, a defendant cannot be sentenced to both probation and confinement under the First Offender Act, as determined in the case of Mason v.

In the case of Rory v Continental Ins Co, the court established that insurance policies are contracts and, in the absence of an applicable statute, the coverage and its limitations are determined entirely by the terms of the contract. This means that the rights and limitations of an insurance policy can be construed without reference to any statute. The court's decision was based on the understanding that insurance policies are contractual agreements between the insurer and the insured, and unless there is a specific statutory requirement, the terms of the contract govern the coverage. Therefore, in this situation, the rights and limitations of the insurance policy can be determined solely through the contractual agreement.","Yes, the rights and limitations of an insurance policy can be determined solely by the terms of the contract and without reference to any applicable statute, as established in the case of Rory v Continental Ins Co."

The recent court decision in Flaiz established that in order to controvert the Director's case for revocation, the driver only needs to present evidence that is inconsistent with a reasonable belief of the arresting officer that the driver was driving while intoxicated. It is not necessary for the driver to present evidence contradicting each and every indication of intoxication presented by the Director. The court in Howdeshell further supports this reasoning. Therefore, under the recent court decisions, the driver does not have to provide evidence contradicting every indication of intoxication in order to contest the case.","No, based on the recent court decisions in Flaiz and Howdeshell, the driver does not need to present evidence contradicting each and every indication of intoxication presented by the Director in order to contest a case of driver's license revocation for refusing a chemical test."

This supposition, which does not account for the possibility of clerical mistakes in a busy prosecutor’s office, is in contrast to the specific, uniform recollections of Officers Argila, McCarthy and Fogarty, who each testified in detail about Garcia’s receipt and subsequent waiver of his Miranda rights, and the drafting and ratification of his statement. (Tr. at 33-39, 98-101, 128-29.) As this Court has no reason to doubt the credibility of the three officers in this case, their specific recollections trump ADA Coyne’s bare assumption that the criminal file jacket accurately represents her conversation with Officer Fogarty.

In this case, Officers Argila, McCarthy, and Fogarty testified in detail about Garcia's receipt and waiver of Miranda rights, as well as the drafting and ratification of his statement. Their specific recollections provide a strong foundation for establishing these facts. Conversely, ADA Coyne's assumption is based on supposition and imperfect records that may contain clerical mistakes. As precedent shows, the credibility of witnesses and specific recollections should be given greater weight over mere assumptions. Therefore, the court cannot solely rely on ADA Coyne's assumption about the conversation with Officer Fogarty to establish Garcia's request for a lawyer.","No, the court cannot solely rely on ADA Coyne's assumption about the conversation with Officer Fogarty to establish Garcia's request for a lawyer, as the specific recollections of Officers Argila, McCarthy, and Fogarty carry more weight in determining the facts of the case."

Thus, the district court was not obligated to independently evaluate the articles and studies referred to by Mr. Firstenberg's experts, as doing so would involve considering hearsay evidence. As established in Wilde v. Westland Dev. Co., the district court cannot take into account inadmissible hearsay when deciding on a summary judgment motion. It was incumbent upon Mr. Firstenberg to establish, through his experts, that the articles and studies constituted reliable scientific authority if he wished to rely on them to demonstrate general causation.

"this case. It states in part, “[w]hen property is damaged, the loss is the cost of repairs, not to exceed the loss had the property been destroyed.” The district court calculated the cost of repairs based upon the bank’s standard hourly rate for its employees’ time, computer time, and administrative overhead-the same rate that the bank uses in charging paying customers. Sabían complains that this was improper because of the profit margin and administrative overhead that is built into these charges. However, had the bank hired an outside contractor to make the repairs these factors would have been built into the charges. Similarly, had it not been necessary for the bank to devote its employees’ time and computer time to making these repairs, the administrative overhead (11th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). However, we need not consider this matter in",Can the bank include profit margin and administrative overhead in their calculation of the cost of repairs for a damaged property?,"The question relates to the calculation of the cost of repairs for a damaged property. The court in the 11th Cir.1993 case established that when property is damaged, the loss is calculated based on the cost of repairs, not exceeding the value if the property was completely destroyed. In this case, the bank calculated the cost of repairs based on its standard hourly rate for its employees' time, computer time, and administrative overhead. Although the plaintiff argues that including profit margin and administrative overhead in this calculation is improper, the court points out that if the bank had hired an outside contractor to make the repairs, these factors would have been included in the charges. Additionally, if the bank did not have to use its employees' time and computer time for the repairs, the administrative overhead would not have been necessary. Therefore, based on this reasoning, it is permissible for the bank to include profit margin and administrative overhead in its calculation of the cost of repairs for the damaged property.","Yes, the bank can include profit margin and administrative overhead in their calculation of the cost of repairs for a damaged property, as established in the 11th Cir.1993 case."

United States v. Scafe and White v.

The court's reasoning is that the evaluation of force should focus on the nature of the force used rather than the end result. Therefore, in situations where unintentional homicide is involved, but there are no deadly weapons, the defendant should have the opportunity to present a defense against ordinary assault and battery. State v. Hare supports this reasoning.","Yes, in situations where involuntary manslaughter is being considered and no deadly weapons are involved, the defendant should receive an additional instruction on the theory of defense against ordinary assault and battery, as established in United States v.

Plaintiffs argue that the documentation which demonstrates the exact dates of all submissions of the alleged false claims to the Government is in possession of Defendants. The court does not expect two former employees, whose employment was terminated almost two years ago, to remember each date. The Ninth Circuit agrees. See United States ex rel.

"to prove the same will amount to a fatal variance and a violation of the defendant’s right to due process of law.” However, as the Supreme Court of Georgia has long held, [t]he general rule that allegations and proof must correspond is based upon the obvious requirements (1) that the accused shall be definitely informed as to the charges against him, so that he may be enabled to present his defense and not be taken by surprise by the evidence offered at the trial; and (2) that he may be protected against another prosecution for the same offense.

"to which such conduct reasonably points.” Boling v. State, 982 N.E.2d 1055, 1057 (Ind. Ct. App. 2013). Henson asserts that there is no evidence that he touched.either Daniel or Patterson. And he maintains that the State did not prove the mens rea elements of each offense. In particular, he contends that .there is. no evidence that he had the specific intent to use the car as a deadly weapon. We address each contention in turn. . . Touching As our Supreme Court has stated, “[w]hile battery requires [a] defen dant to have intended to touch another person, [he] need not personally touch another person since battery may be committed by the unlawful touching by [the] defendant or by any other substance put in motion by [the] defendant.” Matthews v.

Here, the State presented",Was there sufficient evidence to prove that Henson touched either Daniel or Patterson?,"The question pertains to the sufficiency of evidence in proving the act of touching in the case. According to the Indiana Supreme Court in Matthews v. State, a defendant does not need to personally touch another person to be charged with battery. Battery can also be committed through unlawful touching by the defendant or any other substance set in motion by the defendant. Therefore, the requirement is that the defendant intended to touch another person, but the actual physical contact can be indirect. In this case, Henson argues that there is no evidence proving that he touched either Daniel or Patterson. To determine the sufficiency of evidence, the court needs to evaluate whether there is any evidence that indirectly links Henson to the act of touching.","It is necessary to examine the evidence presented to determine whether it sufficiently proves that Henson touched either Daniel or Patterson. The Indiana Supreme Court in Matthews v. State held that battery does not require the defendant to personally touch another person, but rather unlawful touching by the defendant or any substance put in motion by the defendant. Therefore, the sufficiency of evidence will depend on whether there is any indirect evidence linking Henson to the act of touching."
"held that a minor’s cause of action against a defendant, who was added two years after the original complaint was filed, was not barred by the statute of limitations, even though the minor’s legal guardian timely filed the original complaint.

Substantial evidence refers to evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to conclude the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In this evaluation, the court does not weigh the evidence or review the credibility of the witnesses, as established in United States v. Wilson. Therefore, the sufficiency of evidence should not be based on the weight of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses, but rather on whether there is substantial evidence to support a guilty verdict.","No, the sufficiency of evidence in a criminal case should not be evaluated based on the weight of the evidence and credibility of the witnesses, but rather on whether there is substantial evidence to support a conclusion of the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

"circuit court stated an incorrect reason for its denial.’ ” Long v. State, 675 So.2d 532, 533 (Ala.Crim.App.1996), quoting Swicegood v. State, 646 So.2d 159, 160 (Ala.Crim.App.1994). For the reasons that follow, we find that the circuit court was correct in summarily denying all but one of Bearden’s claims. I. Bearden contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to render the judgment or to impose the sentence. He makes two arguments in this regard. First, Bearden contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because, he says, the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant for his arrest was not properly verified. Although couched in jurisdictional terms, this claim does not present a jurisdictional issue. See, e.g., Sumlin v. State, 710 So.2d 941 (Ala.Crim.App.1998) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we agree with the circuit court",Did the circuit court have jurisdiction to render the judgment or impose the sentence in Bearden's case?,"The question revolves around the issue of jurisdiction of the circuit court. Bearden argues that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction due to the improper verification of the affidavit supporting the warrant for his arrest. However, the court clarifies that this claim does not present a jurisdictional issue but rather a separate matter. The Sumlin v. State case supports this distinction. Therefore, based on this legal understanding, the circuit court was correct in summarily denying most of Bearden's claims, including his jurisdictional argument.","Yes, the circuit court had jurisdiction to render the judgment and impose the sentence in Bearden's case, as the claim regarding the verification of the affidavit did not present a jurisdictional issue according to the court's decision and the Sumlin v.

In this regard, courts in the Commonwealth have typically assessed liability to defendants in three distinct areas: (1) where the plaintiff sustained injuries from a fall on an unnatural accumulation of ice or snow that formed as a result of water flowing from a defective roof, see Baldassari v. Produce Terminal Realty Corp., 361 Mass. 738, 744 (1972) (<HOLDING>); (2) where the plaintiff sustained injuries",Can liability be imposed on defendants for injuries caused by a fall on naturally accumulated snow and ice in Massachusetts?,"The question revolves around the imposition of liability for injuries caused by naturally accumulated snow and ice.

However, liability may arise if there is some act or failure to act that changes the condition of the natural accumulation, causing it to become a hazard. Courts in Massachusetts have identified three distinct areas where liability may be imposed: (1) when a fall occurs on an unnatural accumulation of ice or snow resulting from water flowing from a defective roof; and (2) when a fall occurs due to a hazardous condition caused by elements in connection with the land. Therefore, in cases where the plaintiff's injuries were caused by a fall on naturally accumulated snow and ice without any artificial element contributing to the hazard, liability cannot be imposed on the defendants.","No, liability cannot be imposed on defendants for injuries caused by a fall on naturally accumulated snow and ice in Massachusetts unless there is an artificial element present that changes the condition of the natural accumulation, making it hazardous."

"makes, particularly when those arguments are raised only in passing.” United States v. Madden, 515 F.3d 601, 611 (6th Cir.2008). In his sentencing position paper, Escalon-Velasquez did not argue that a within-Guidelines sentence would waste government resources. His counsel raised the issue only at the end of his presentation, stating cursorily that “the resources that we would expend in incarcerating him any longer than necessary for him to be — for him to be deported should also be taken into consideration.” (Sentencing Hr’g Tr. 14.) We therefore conclude that the argument was raised “only in passing,” and the court was not required to address explicitly this mitigating argument to satisfy the constitutional requirement of procedural reasonableness.

This constitutes a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for terminating Ms. Barnett's employment. In Texas Dept. of Community Affairs v. Burdine, it was held that if the employer provides a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the termination, the burden shifts to the employee to produce evidence of discriminatory intent.

"the light most favorable to the non-moving party, there is sufficient evidence for a trier of fact to find for that party. A non-moving party cannot withstand summary judgment, however, by introduction of a “mere scintilla” of evidence in its favor. See Ciminillo, 434 F.3d at 464. Before this court, the plaintiff first argues that the finding of probable cause by the state judge at the preliminary-examination stage of the criminal proceedings should not affect the federal courts’ decisions regarding the merits of his claims of wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution. He does so even though each of those later claims contains, as an element, the lack of probable cause to pursue the particular action. See, e.g., Criss v.

Anderson, 625 F.3d 294, 308 (6th",How does the finding of probable cause in the preliminary-examination stage of criminal proceedings affect the decisions made by federal courts regarding claims of wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution?,"The question at hand pertains to the impact of the finding of probable cause at the preliminary-examination stage of criminal proceedings on federal court decisions concerning claims of wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution. In cases such as Criss v. City of Kent and Sykes v. Anderson, it has been established that both wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution claims require the element of the lack of probable cause. Despite this requirement, the plaintiff argues that the finding of probable cause at the preliminary-examination stage should not influence the federal court's evaluation of the merits of these claims. However, based on the precedent set by Criss v. City of Kent and Sykes v. Anderson, it can be inferred that the finding of probable cause at the preliminary-examination stage has a significant impact on the subsequent decisions made by federal courts regarding claims of wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution.","The finding of probable cause at the preliminary-examination stage of criminal proceedings does have a significant impact on the decisions made by federal courts concerning claims of wrongful arrest and malicious prosecution.

In Schoemehl v. Treasurer of Missouri, the court held that if a claimant died of a non-work related cause while their claim was still pending, the surviving spouse was entitled to receive benefits for the duration of their life. However, the General Assembly amended the relevant sections in 2008 to abrogate Schoemehl and clarify that compensation for a permanent total disability is only payable during the lifetime of the injured employee and not to dependents after the employee's death from causes unrelated to the work injury. This decision was further supported by the Gervich v. Condaire, Inc. case. It was established that the 2008 amendments to the Workers' Compensation Act cannot be applied retroactively. Therefore, based on this legal reasoning, a claimant's surviving spouse would not be eligible to receive benefits if the claimant died of a non-work related cause while the claim is still pending.","No, a claimant's surviving spouse cannot receive benefits if the claimant dies of a non-work related cause while the claim is still pending, as clarified by the amendments to the Workers' Compensation Act and supported by the Schoemehl and Gervich cases."

Additionally, Dr. Coulibaly explicitly states that the FTCA is not applicable to his FMLA lawsuit. However, the question of whether the FMLA permits actions against individuals instead of just employers has resulted in a circuit split. Some circuits, such as the Sixth Circuit in Mitchell v. Chapman, have held that individuals can be held liable under the FMLA, while others, like the Eleventh Circuit in Wascura v. Carver, have taken a different stance. Therefore, it is uncertain whether Dr. Coulibaly can rely on the FTCA for waiver of sovereign immunity in this case.","It is uncertain whether Dr. Coulibaly can rely on the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) for any waiver of sovereign immunity in this case involving equitable relief and reinstatement, as the issue of whether the FMLA permits actions against individuals is a subject of a circuit split."

Similarly, the demand for recognition from other sovereigns is not implicated in West Virginia's injury.

The defendant argues that the Eastern District of Texas has no connection to the facts of the case, while the San Antonio Division is intimately connected. However, the plaintiff presents specific acts committed by both parties in the Eastern District, suggesting a connection to the district. In the case of Norwood v. Kirkpatrick, the court held that the party seeking to transfer the case has the burden of proving that the convenience of the parties and witnesses, as well as the interest of justice, favors the transfer.

"Report or a Product Quantity Change SE Report from the company. Id. at 016, 025 (emphasis added). For new tobacco products already on the market, the FDA has said that it will not take enforcement action if the product manufacturer files the appropriate abbreviated SE Report within 30 days of the date of the issuance of the Second SE Guidance. Id, at 016, 025. Plainly, in light of the Guidance, tobacco companies are given a choice: either comply with the FDA’s interpretation of the TCA by filing the required SE report when making a label or quantity change to their product, or risk a possible “enforcement action.” But, of course, that is no real choice at all. The Guidance thus poses an immediate and significant practical hardship to Plaintiffs. See CSI Aviation Svcs., 637 F.3d at 412 (<HOLDING>) (citation and internal quotation marks",What options do tobacco companies have when faced with the FDA's interpretation of the TCA regarding filing SE reports for label or quantity changes to their products?,"The question pertains to the options available to tobacco companies in response to the FDA's interpretation of the Tobacco Control Act (TCA) regarding the submission of SE (Substantial Equivalence) reports for label or quantity changes in their products. According to the context, the FDA has indicated that it will not take enforcement action if tobacco companies submit the appropriate abbreviated SE report within 30 days of the issuance of the Second SE Guidance for new tobacco products already on the market. However, failure to comply with this interpretation may lead to a possible ""enforcement action."" Therefore, tobacco companies are essentially faced with two choices: either comply with the FDA's interpretation by filing the required SE report or risk potential enforcement action. The practical hardship posed by the FDA's guidance further reinforces the limited options available to the plaintiffs in this case.","Tobacco companies have the option to either comply with the FDA's interpretation of the TCA by submitting the necessary SE report within 30 days of the issuance of the Second SE Guidance for label or quantity changes in their products, or they can choose not to comply and face the risk of potential enforcement action."
"sold, handled, distributed or disposed of by you....” Section V, 15.a. The court was unable to locate any Indiana or Seventh Circuit case law dealing with the definition of “product” as that term is used in CGL insurance policies, and, in fact, neither party in this case cites any case that specifically defines the term. The Ninth Circuit offers some assistance in the case of Hydro Systems, Inc. v. Continental Ins. Co., 929 F.2d 472 (9th Cir.1991), wherein the court wrote: Several courts have examined the meaning of the term “product” as it relates to product hazard exceptions.

While the court was unable to find any specific Indiana or Seventh Circuit case law on this issue, reference can be made to the Ninth Circuit's decision in Hydro Systems, Inc. v. Continental Ins. Co., where the court provided some guidance. According to this case, the majority of courts define ""product"" as goods or services that the insured deals in as their stock or trade. This definition implies that products are typically items or services that the insured sells, handles, distributes, or disposes of. Additionally, the court cites CPS Chem. Co. Inc. v.

"the Agreement. For example, assume that Aviall and Cooper entered into a contract that provided only that Aviall would assume liability for Cooper’s pre-closing debt to Jones Company. If Jones Company made demand on Cooper, who in turn made demand on Aviall, who then refused to pay the debt, Cooper could presumably bring a breach of contract claim against Aviall for failing to honor its contractual obligation to assume liability for the Jones Company debt. But this right would be based on a contract that reflected that this was the parties’ objective intent. In the present case, however, the Agreement has other relevant provisions, and the contract must be interpreted as a whole. See, e.g., Bank One, Tex., N.A. v.

One relevant provision is section 1.03, but there are other provisions that may impact the interpretation of the contract. According to the case Bank One, Tex., N.A. v.

"221-22, 52 N.W.2d 458, 465 (1952). In Mack, 292 N.W.2d at 768-69, 772, we added an additional consideration to the Frye analysis in deciding that testimony developed through the aid of hypnosis was inadmissible. Although citing the Frye general acceptance standard, our primary concern in Mack was with the unreliability of memories produced while under hypnosis. See Mack, 292 N.W.2d at 768-69. As a result, the test for admissibility of novel scientific evidence in Minnesota developed into the two-prong Frye-Mack standard. First, a novel scientific technique must be generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, and second, the particular evidence derived from that test must have a foundation that is scientifically reliable. See State v. Anderson, 379 N.W.2d 70, 79 (Minn.1985) (<HOLDING>); see also State v. Jobe, 486 N.W.2d 407,",Can evidence obtained through the use of hypnosis be deemed admissible in Minnesota courts?,"The question pertains to the admissibility of evidence derived from hypnosis in Minnesota courts. The court in Mack v. State established the Frye-Mack standard, which consists of two prongs for determining the admissibility of novel scientific evidence. Firstly, the scientific technique used must be generally accepted in the relevant scientific community. Secondly, the particular evidence derived from the technique must have a foundation that is scientifically reliable. This standard was established due to concerns over the unreliability of memories produced under hypnosis. Hence, in Minnesota, for evidence obtained through hypnosis to be admissible, it must fulfill both prongs of the Frye-Mack standard.","In Minnesota, evidence obtained through the use of hypnosis can be deemed admissible if it meets the two-prong Frye-Mack standard.

"While we agree with the statement-in Brown that “[s]ometimes it is necessary for ... the summary statement to provide a context reference” for the initiative petition, we do not find that failure to do so, where the consequences are potentially ever changing due to the political landscape, will always render the summary insufficient. See Brown, 370 S.W.3d at 654. We find that the effect that the Initiative Petitions may eventually have on the provisions of SB19 does not require the court to step in and redraft the summaries in order for them to be fair and sufficient. It is commonly understood that constitutional amendments will supersede statutes that are in contravention with the amended constitutional provision. Labrayere v.

"also revealed that Cabral erroneously informed the FBI that Seda traveled to Saudi Arabia for a Hajj in 2000. Draft interview summaries revealed additional inconsistencies. For example, one draft summary of an interview with Richard contained the statement that “[Richard] Cabral did not recall Sedaghaty discussing the topic of Kosovo or supporting mujahedin there” while another draft of the summary excluded that same statement. Another early draft revealed a conflict about the amount of the supposed payments that were collected at the end of the Hajj. Without the suppressed materials, Seda’s counsel was severely limited on cross examination, unable to explore, let alone establish, grounds for Cabral’s possible bias. See United States v. Schoneberg, 396 F.3d 1036, 1042 (9th Cir.2005) (<HOLDING>). Taken together with the substantive issues","Considering the inconsistencies in the draft interview summaries and suppressed materials, was Seda's counsel able to effectively cross-examine Richard Cabral and establish grounds for bias during the trial?","The question revolves around the effectiveness of Seda's counsel's cross-examination and ability to establish grounds for bias in the trial. The court in United States v. Schoneberg has established that the suppression of materials can severely limit a defense counsel's ability to explore and establish grounds for a witness's possible bias. In this case, the draft interview summaries contain inconsistencies, such as conflicting statements and omissions. These inconsistencies, along with the suppressed materials, could have been crucial for Seda's counsel to challenge Richard Cabral's credibility and establish possible bias. Without access to these materials, Seda's counsel was severely limited in their cross-examination and unable to fully explore and establish grounds for Cabral's bias.","No, Seda's counsel was severely limited in their ability to effectively cross-examine Richard Cabral and establish grounds for his possible bias due to the inconsistencies in the draft interview summaries and suppression of materials, as established in the United States v.

"910 (Ky.1995)). More specifically, Kentucky courts have consistently held that police officers only owe a duty of care to specific individuals if there -is a “special relationship” between the officer and individual. City of Florence v. Chipman, 38 S.W.3d 387, 392 (Ky.2001); Ashby v. City of Louisville, 841 S.W.2d.184 (Ky.App.1992). However, Kentucky has yet to address the specific question presented here — whether a police officer owes a suspect the duty to investigate allegations of criminal activity with reasonable care. Although Kentucky law is seemingly silent on the specific issue presented herein, other jurisdictions have uniformly refused to recognize a tort of negligent investigation. See Turner v. Taylor, No. 7:09-cv-02858-JMC, 2011 WL 3794086, at *9 (D.S.C. Aug. 25, 2011) (<HOLDING>); Fernander v.

"failed to establish that Kennedy’s stock sales were “unusual.” As discussed above, Kennedy disclosed all his holdings in the November announcement. The additional 30,000 shares that Kennedy sold in January represented less than 11% of his holdings; after the sale, Kennedy owned approximately 259,000 shares and/or options of IMCERA stock. Further, the complaint failed to allege that any other defendant sold any shares of IMCERA stock during this period. The fact that the other defendants did not sell their shares during the relevant class period undermines plaintiffs’ claim that defendants delayed notifying the public “so that they could sell their stock at a huge profit.” In re Cypress Semiconductor Sec. Litig., Fed.Sec.L.Rep. (CCH) ¶ 97,060, at 94,-697, 1992 WL 394927 (N.D.Cal.1992) (<HOLDING>).

"at least one district court to conclude that the Eleventh Circuit no longer strictly requires proof of bad faith as an essential element of spoliation. See Brown v. Chertoff, 563 F.Supp.2d 1372, 1381 (S.D.Ga.2008). Other district courts have rejected this interpretation of Flury. See Managed Care Solutions, Inc. v. Essent Healthcare, Inc., 736 F.Supp.2d 1317, 1328 n. 16 (S.D.Fla.2010); Woodard v. Wal-Mart Stores East LP, 801 F.Supp.2d 1363, 1372 (M.D.Ga.2011). While the degree of bad faith necessary to impose sanctions may not be entirely clear, it is clear that simple negligence is not enough but actual malice is not required. See, e.g., Mann v. Taser Int’l, Inc., 588 F.3d 1291, 1310 (11th Cir.2009) (noting that malice is not required for finding of bad faith); Bashir, 119 F.3d at 931 (<HOLDING>); Preferred Care Partners Holding Corp. v.",Is proof of bad faith required as an essential element of spoliation in the Eleventh Circuit?,"The issue at hand relates to the requirement of proving bad faith in spoliation cases in the Eleventh Circuit. While there is some disagreement among district courts, it has been observed that the Eleventh Circuit may no longer strictly require proof of bad faith as an essential element of spoliation. The case of Brown v. Chertoff supports this interpretation. However, other district courts, such as in Managed Care Solutions, Inc. v. Essent Healthcare and Woodard v. Wal-Mart Stores East LP, have rejected this perspective. It is recognized that simple negligence is insufficient to impose sanctions, but actual malice is not necessarily required. For example, in Mann v. Taser Int'l, Inc., the court noted that malice is not necessary to establish bad faith. Therefore, while the exact level of bad faith needed for sanctions may not be entirely clear, it is evident that a higher degree than negligence is necessary but not to the extent of requiring actual malice.","In the Eleventh Circuit, proof of bad faith is not strictly required as an essential element of spoliation, as determined in cases such as Brown v. Chertoff. While there is some discrepancy among district courts, it is clear that simple negligence is insufficient, but actual malice is not necessary.

"whether or not a certificate has been filed. TOLLING OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS The hearing officer found that even if the limitations period began to run before the certificate was filed, the period should be tolled during the time the city was attempting to obtain worker’s signature on the certificate. Worker’s refusal to execute the certificate, according to the hearing officer, provided good cause for the city’s failure to file its claim against the fund within the limitations period. Tolling of a limitations period is normally accomplished by statute. See NMSA 1978, §§ 37-1-9 to 37-1-12 (tolling for absence or concealment of a debtor, minority, incapacity, death of claimant, and stay of action pursuant to injunction); cf. Hardin v.

The hearing officer determined that the limitations period should be tolled during the time the city was trying to obtain the worker's signature on the certificate, even if the limitations period had started before the certificate was filed. Tolling of a limitations period is generally regulated by statute, as outlined in NMSA 1978. These statutes address different situations that can lead to the tolling of the limitations period such as the absence or concealment of a debtor, minority, incapacity, death of the claimant, and stay of action pursuant to injunction. According to the hearing officer, the worker's refusal to execute the certificate provided good cause for the city's failure to file its claim within the limitations period. The court may consider this refusal as a valid reason for tolling the limitations period.","Yes, it is possible for the limitations period to be tolled if the city was attempting to obtain the worker's signature on a certificate but the worker refused to execute it.

Because of the timing of this filing — prior to any decision in the case, plaintiff's request for reconsideration is not ripe for judicial review.

This rule presupposes that the court has already rendered a decision or taken some other action in the case before entertaining a motion for reconsideration.

"information about their search precludes a finding of good faith on their part. And it is enough for us to make clear that Thomas in no way protects evidence obtained on the basis of a warrant which, like this one, was gotten not only illegally but in clear bad faith. CONCLUSION Because the district court’s findings, on the basis of which it correctly concluded that the search in this case constituted an illegal invasion of the defendant’s curtilage, were not clearly erroneous, and because the good faith exception, valuable though it is, does not apply on these facts, we affirm the decision of the district court. 1 . The government argues that in United States v. Paulino, 850 F.2d 93, 95 108 S.Ct. 128, 98 L.Ed.2d 85 (1987); United States v. Ceballos, 812 F.2d 42, 46-47 (2d Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>).

The court's decision in this case affirms that the search conducted by the government was an illegal invasion of the defendant's curtilage. The district court's findings, upon which the decision was based, were not deemed to be clearly erroneous. In this context, the application of the good faith exception is evaluated. The court clarifies that evidence obtained on the basis of a warrant obtained illegally and in clear bad faith is not protected under the good faith exception. This reasoning is consistent with prior cases such as United States v. Paulino and United States v. Ceballos.

"no immediate action to cure the code violations because the Debtor had filed a bankruptcy petition and the automatic stay would have to be lifted before IPC could proceed. Notwithstanding this explicit admonition, the Knights thereafter served the Notices and then filed the unlawful detainer complaint seeking to recover possession of the Property. The reason given by the Knights’ counsel for his chosen course of action— bankruptcy court is slow — does not help them escape the conclusion that their actions were willful. Although the Knights may not have had the specific intent to violate the automatic stay, the Knights knew of the automatic stay and their actions were intentional, thus satisfying the definition of a “willful” violation of the automatic stay.

However, the Knights disregarded this warning and served the Notices and filed the unlawful detainer complaint. Their justification for their actions, claiming that the bankruptcy court is slow, does not exempt them from being considered willful violators. Even if the Knights did not specifically intend to violate the automatic stay, their knowledge of its existence and their intentional actions classify their violation as ""willful"" in accordance with the definition established in Bloom v.

In the Dayco Corp. v. NLRB case, the court emphasized the importance of considering a single sentence in a letter within its entire statement and background. While HCEA places significant weight on this particular sentence, it is crucial to analyze the full text of the letter to determine the intention behind Stewart's statement. After reviewing the complete letter, it becomes evident that Stewart's statement is a request rather than an order. Therefore, in the given context, the statement should be interpreted as a request rather than a command, according to the Notab 2d case.","No, in the context of the letter, the statement made by Stewart should be considered a request rather than a command, as supported by the Dayco Corp. v.

Although the Plaintiffs may be correct that the Defendant failed to comply with the DOL’s recording requirements, such a failure would not result in a finding that the retail-service exemption is inapplicable. Rather, this Court has determined that, when an employer fails to comply with the DOL’s recording requirements, the Court should simply issue an injunction requiring the employer to comply with those requirements in the future.

In the case of Reich v. Cole Enterprises, Inc., it was determined that failure to comply with the recording requirements does not result in the exemption being deemed inapplicable. Rather, the court's remedy in such cases is to issue an injunction, compelling the employer to comply with the recording requirements in the future. This decision is consistent with the holding in Brennan v. Valley Towing Co., Inc., which supports the idea that non-compliance with recording requirements does not automatically negate the applicability of the exemption. Therefore, even if the Defendant failed to comply with the recording requirements, it would not necessarily mean that the retail-service exemption is inapplicable.","No, the failure to comply with the Department of Labor's recording requirements by the Defendant does not render the retail-service exemption inapplicable.

"substances may have been marijuana being, used in a criminal enterprise in which the marijuana was delivered in amounts of less than one-fourth of an ounce, which would not constitute a felony offense. Considering the evidence, in the light most favorable to the challenged finding, indulging every reasonable inference that would support it, crediting favorable evidence if reasonable jurors could, and disregarding contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not, the trial evidence would not enable reasonable and fair-minded people to find that the money is contraband under the charge submitted to the jury. Therefore, the evidence is legally insufficient to support the jury’s finding that the seized money is contraband. 1 . See Osterberg v. Peca, 12 S.W.3d 31, 55 (Tex.2000) (<HOLDING>); Hirschfeld Steel Co. v. Kellogg Brown & Root,",Can the money seized in this case be considered contraband based on the trial evidence?,"The question pertains to whether the seized money can be classified as contraband based on the evidence presented at the trial. Reviewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the finding, and considering every reasonable inference in support of it, the court found that the trial evidence does not establish that the money is contraband. The court applied the legal principle of indulging favorable evidence and disregarding contrary evidence if reasonable jurors could not find it credible. Therefore, based on the evidence submitted to the jury, reasonable and fair-minded people would not be able to conclude that the seized money is contraband. This conclusion aligns with the holding in the case of Osterberg v.

"Rev. at 1404, the employer’s clear breach of the employment contract, the employer’s benefit in terms of enhanced chances of mitigation and the public’s interest in “the need for stability in labor relations,” Pierce, 84 N.J. at 66, plaintiff retains his cause of action for breach of contract. We are confident that in the modern employment context where there is a position-specific employment contract and an employee resigns after his employer without justification forces that employee to choose from among demotion, termination or resignation, it must be concluded that the employer remains subject to liability for that breach unless facts clearly demonstrate a fairly bargained release of the employer.

In Pierce v.

The court considered factors such as the enhanced chances of mitigation for the employer and the public's interest in stability in labor relations. The court emphasized that in the modern employment context, where there is a specific employment contract tied to the position and an employee is coerced into resigning, the employer remains liable for the breach of contract unless there is clear evidence of a mutually agreed release.

"could be controlled by the government or vetoed without good reason. Consistent with this principle of non-interference, courts have identified violations of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel where the government obtains incriminating statements from a defendant outside the presence of counsel and then introduces those statements at trial.

According to Supreme Court precedents such as Jackson v. Denno and Massiah v. United States, it is established that if the government obtains incriminating statements from a defendant without the presence of counsel and then introduces those statements at trial, it violates the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to counsel. This violation occurs because the government's actions interfere with the attorney-client relationship and prevent defense counsel from fully participating in the adversarial fact-finding process. The case of Herring v. New York further reinforces this reasoning. Therefore, in situations where the government obtains incriminating statements in the absence of counsel and uses them as evidence in a trial, the Sixth Amendment would be violated.","Yes, the government can violate the Sixth Amendment by obtaining incriminating statements from a defendant outside the presence of counsel and then introducing those statements at trial, as established in cases such as Jackson v.

Second, it must be proven that the defendant did so knowingly and intentionally, meaning that they were aware of their actions and purposefully engaged in the distribution. Finally, the government must demonstrate that the defendant knew or was aware that the substance being distributed was a controlled substance.

In the case of Beathard, it was established that the informant was acting covertly on behalf of law enforcement, hoping to have his charges dismissed through ""case credits."" Given this context, the informant's testimony is not considered reliable on its own. Therefore, the court must exclude the informant's testimony and assess whether there is any other evidence linking the defendant to the offense. In the Cantelon case, for example, the officer provided testimony regarding the informant meeting the defendant at an agreed time and place, being searched, carrying cash and an audio recorder, and returning without the cash. This additional evidence strengthens the connection between the defendant and the offense. Applying the same reasoning, in order to determine the sufficiency of the corroborating evidence in this case, all testimony from the informant should be disregarded, and the court must assess whether there is other evidence linking the defendant to the offense of possession with intent to deliver.","The sufficiency of the informant's testimony to connect the defendant to the offense of possession with intent to deliver cannot be determined solely based on the informant's testimony being unreliable due to the informant's covert actions on behalf of law enforcement.

The trial court sentenced Mr. Perez to concurrent terms of life imprisonment for the home invasion robbery and the armed burglary and to another concurrent term of fifteen years’ imprisonment for the false impersonation offense.

"— affects the FDIC’s ability to function as receiver in the case. The “disposition of a failed [bank’s] assets ... is one of the quintessential statutory powers of the [FDIC] as a receiver.” Pyramid Constr. Co. v. Wind River Petroleum, Inc., 866 F.Supp. 513, 517 (D.Utah 1994). If an asset sold to a third-party purchaser is subject to dilution in a later judicial proceeding, there would be a substantial chilling effect upon the receiver’s ability to perform its statutory functions. In Pyramid, the court rejected the argument that § 1821(j) did not apply because a plaintiff sought relief against the receiver’s successor. The plaintiffs argument in Pyramid sounded much like Dittmer’s here — because the receiver had alread 4, 1993 WL 149084, at *2 (N.D.Cal. April 30, 1993) (unpublished) (<HOLDING>). Of the many cases Dittmer cites in support of",Can a third-party purchaser of a failed bank's assets be subject to dilution in a later judicial proceeding?,"This question pertains to the applicability of Section 1821(j) in the context of a third-party purchaser of a failed bank's assets. As stated in Pyramid Constr. Co. v. Wind River Petroleum, Inc., the FDIC's ability to dispose of a failed bank's assets is one of its essential statutory powers as a receiver. Hence, if an asset sold to a third-party purchaser could potentially be diluted in a subsequent judicial proceeding, it would significantly impede the receiver's ability to carry out its statutory functions. In the Pyramid case, the court ruled against the argument that Section 1821(j) does not apply when relief is sought against the receiver's successor. This aligns with the present situation where Dittmer is making a similar argument. Therefore, based on the Pyramid case and supporting authorities, it can be inferred that a third-party purchaser of a failed bank's assets can indeed be subject to dilution in a later judicial proceeding.","Yes, a third-party purchaser of a failed bank's assets can be subject to dilution in a subsequent judicial proceeding, as established in the Pyramid Constr.

The affidavit raised a genuine issue of material fact, emphasizing that the reason for her termination was poor performance. This genuine dispute precluded summary judgment. Similarly, in the case of Ferguson v. Small, the court held that a violation of Title VII could be established when there were inconsistencies in the employer's version of events in relation to the plaintiff's departure.

The plaintiff's complaint fails to allege that Novar exercised ""complete domination and control"" over Indalex, as required by the Glenn v. Wagner standard. While the complaint does assert that Novar had control over Indalex, this alone is insufficient to demonstrate ""complete domination and control"".

"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant knowingly and intentionally became a member of the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment as opposed to some other conspiracy. Proof that the defendant was only a member of some other conspiracy is not enough to convict.

Therefore, it is permissible for the press to publish true information obtained from public court documents that were open to public inspection, unless specific circumstances warrant restrictions.","Yes, it is permissible for the press to publish true information obtained from public court documents that were open to public inspection, as established in Cox Broadcasting Corp. v.

"whether Essie can make a pri-ma facie case of discrimination. The burden would then shift to Goodman to demonstrate a “neutral explanation” for employing two of his three allocated peremptory challenges to exclude members of the black race. We agree with Essie that her decedent, Jones, would have been entitled to the benefit of Edmonson.

According to the Supreme Court decision in Edmonson, if a plaintiff like Essie can demonstrate facts supporting a prima facie case of discrimination, the burden of proof then shifts to the defendant, Goodman, who must provide a ""neutral explanation"" for their actions. This means that once Essie establishes a prima facie case, Goodman must show that there are non-discriminatory reasons for using two out of three allotted peremptory challenges to exclude members of the black race. The application of the Edmonson rule in this case is supported by the Supreme Court's decision in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia. The retroactivity of new rules announced by the Supreme Court has been subject to various considerations and standards in the past, as demonstrated in cases such as Teague v. Lane and Griffith v. Kentucky.","The standard for establishing a prima facie case of discrimination is that the plaintiff must present facts that support a reasonable inference of discriminatory intent. If the plaintiff successfully meets this standard, the burden of proof shifts to the defendant to provide a ""neutral explanation"" for their actions.

The application of the Edmonson rule to this situation is justified based on the Supreme Court's decision in James B. Beam Distilling Co. v. Georgia. The retroactivity of new Supreme Court rules has been subject to different considerations in the past, as shown in cases like Teague v. Lane and Griffith v. Kentucky."

On the other hand, work-product protection, which shields materials prepared by an attorney in anticipation of litigation, also requires the party asserting waiver to bear the burden of proof. However, unlike attorney-client privilege, work-product protection is not automatically waived when disclosed to a third party. Therefore, establishing waiver for work-product protection requires additional evidence or circumstances showing the intent to waive the protection. The case law references of High Tech Communications and In re Auclair further support this distinction.","Both attorney-client privilege and work-product protection require the burden of proving waiver to fall on the party asserting it.

Am. Trucking Ass’ns, 581 U.S. 457, 472, 121 S.Ct. 908, 149 L.Ed.2d 1 (2001); see also Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371-72, 109 S.Ct. 647, 102 L.Ed.2d 714 (1989). Among Congress’s legislative powers is the authority to determine the temporal scope of a statute. See, e.g., City of New York v. Permanent Mission of India to the U.N., 618 F.3d 172, 195 (2d Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>). That determination is particularly",Can legislative powers be delegated to another branch of government according to the non-delegation doctrine?,"The question concerns the non-delegation doctrine and its application to legislative powers. The Constitution explicitly states that all legislative powers are vested in Congress, indicating that the principle of separation of powers prohibits the delegation of legislative powers to another branch of government. This principle was confirmed in Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns and Mistretta v. United States, where the non-delegation doctrine was upheld. The Court clarified that Congress cannot transfer its legislative authority to another entity. However, Congress does have the power to determine the temporal scope of a statute, as established in City of New York v. Permanent Mission of India to the U.N. Ultimately, according to the non-delegation doctrine, legislative powers cannot be delegated to another branch of government.","No, according to the non-delegation doctrine, legislative powers cannot be delegated to another branch of government, as confirmed in Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass’ns, Mistretta v. United States, and City of New York v. Permanent Mission of India to the U.N."
"the employee and such as to render the employee unfit for his or her position, thus making dismissal justifiable and for the good of the service.” Perry v. State Civil Serv. Comm’n, 38 A.3d 942, 951 (Pa.Cmwlth.2011) (citations omitted) (quoting Pa. Bd. of Prob. & Parole v. State Civil Serv. Comm’n, 4 A.3d 1106, 1112 (Pa.Cmwlth.2010)). Here, the Chancellor ultimately found that the University suspended and subsequently discharged Fisler as a result of his poor job performance over an extended period of time following repeated warnings relating to his poor job performance. Continuing and regular poor job performance in the face of repeated warnings certainly meets the requirements for a just cause termination. See, e.g., Wei v. State Civil Serv. Comm’n, 961 A.2d 254, 259 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) (<HOLDING>), appeal denied, 601 Pa. 705, 973 A.2d 1008",Can an employee be suspended or terminated for poor job performance if they have received multiple warnings?,"The question pertains to the suspension or termination of an employee based on poor job performance. In Perry v. State Civil Serv. Comm'n, it was established that an employee can be deemed unfit for their position if their poor job performance is significant enough to justify dismissal and is for the good of the service. The Chancellor's findings in this case indicated that the University suspended and subsequently discharged the employee due to their prolonged and consistent poor job performance, despite having received repeated warnings. This aligns with the requirements for a just cause termination, as demonstrated in the Wei v. State Civil Serv. Comm'n case. Therefore, if an employee demonstrates continuing and regular poor job performance despite being warned, it can be grounds for their suspension or termination.","Yes, an employee can be suspended or terminated for poor job performance if they have received multiple warnings, as long as their poor performance is significant enough to justify dismissal and is for the good of the service, as established in the Perry v. State Civil Serv. Comm'n and Wei v. State Civil Serv. Comm'n cases."
"fees awarded under the statute should be payable to the attorney, since a different interpretation would render the Savings Clause superfluous, noted that its decision best satisfied the purpose of the EAJA, while a decision paying fees to the plaintiff and subjecting them to administrative offset would subvert the legislature’s intent. Id. Likewise, in Richardson v. Astrue, the Western District of Missouri determined that a fee award under the EAJA must be paid to counsel, since “[cjlearly an award for attorney’s fees is intended to compensate the attorney, not generate income for the claimant so that it may be attached by other federal agencies.” No. 06-0331-CV-W-SWH, at *2 (W.D.

Astrue, No. 5:06-cv-198-OC-GRJ","Who should the fee awarded under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) be payable to, the attorney or the plaintiff?","The question pertains to the interpretation of the EAJA and the allocation of fee awards. In the case of Richardson v. Astrue, the court in the Western District of Missouri concluded that fee awards under the EAJA should be paid to counsel, as they are intended to compensate the attorney rather than generating income for the claimant. This interpretation aligns with the purpose and intent of the EAJA, ensuring that attorneys are adequately compensated for their services. Another case, Whatley v. Astrue, and Hagman v. Astrue, support this line of reasoning.","The fee awarded under the EAJA should be payable to the attorney, as established in Richardson v. Astrue, Whatley v. Astrue, and Hagman v. Astrue."
"the district court committed no error in denying Plaintiffs' motion to amend their complaint and add a claim for disparate impact discrimination based on Department of Education regulations promulgated under § 602. 8 . Noteworthy among the district court cases are the following. In South Camden Citizens in Action v. New Jersey Dep’t. of Envtl. Prot., 145 F.Supp.2d 505 (D.N.J.2001), the district court had issued an injunction and declaratory judgment against the commissioner of the state's environmental protection agency for issuing air permits that the court determined had a disparate impact in violation of the regulations passed pursuant to § 602 by the Environmental Protection Agency.

Prot., the district court granted an injunction and declaratory judgment against the state's environmental protection agency for issuing air permits that were found to have a disparate impact in violation of the regulations passed under § 602 by the Environmental Protection Agency. However, it is important to note that the Sandoval decision by the Supreme Court requires clear intent from Congress to confer individual rights on plaintiffs. Therefore, in this case, the Plaintiffs would not be able to add a claim for disparate impact discrimination based on Department of Education regulations under § 602, as the regulations are not intended to create individual rights.","No, the Plaintiffs cannot add a claim for disparate impact discrimination based on Department of Education regulations under § 602, as clarified by the Sandoval decision, which requires clear intent from Congress to confer individual rights on plaintiffs."
"$1,350,-000, the court is concerned about Prudential serving as its own surety. Prudential is very much an interested stakeholder in the instant suit. Under these circumstances, we do not believe that the claimant’s rights would be as fully protected as if the bond carried a surety .other than Prudential. Notwithstanding that Prudential is on a fist of sureties approved in the District of Kansas, we believe that a separate surety is necessary to more adequately protect the rights of the claimants by giving them two independent parties from whom to collect. See Wilmington Trust Co. v. Gillespie, 397 F.Supp. 1337 (D.Del.1975) (requiring bond in Rule 22 interpleader even where stakeholder was disinterested); but cf, Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v.

We conclude that we lack jurisdiction over",Is it permissible for Prudential to serve as its own surety in the instant suit?,"The court expresses concern about Prudential serving as its own surety in the instant suit, as it is an interested stakeholder. The court believes that the claimant's rights would not be fully protected if Prudential were to act as its own surety. The court cites the case of Wilmington Trust Co. v. Gillespie, where a separate surety was deemed necessary in an interpleader case to adequately protect the rights of the claimants by providing them with two independent parties to collect from. Although Prudential is on the list of approved sureties in the District of Kansas, the court believes that having a separate surety is more favorable. However, a contrasting perspective can be seen in the case of Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Schmitt. Based on these considerations, it can be concluded that allowing Prudential to serve as its own surety may not fully protect the claimants' rights, and a separate surety may be necessary.","No, it is not advisable for Prudential to serve as its own surety in the instant suit, as stated in the case of Wilmington Trust Co. v.

"fiduciary relationship which results from the manifestation of consent by one person to another that the other shall act on his behalf and subject to his control, and consent by the other to so act.” Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1(1). There is no manifestation by either the federal government or the State of California of an intent to create an agency relationship under the facts of this case. First, both the Supreme Court and our predecessor court, the United States Court of Claims, have held that the federal government’s conditioning a state or locality’s receipt of federal funds on the state’s taking a particular action does not make that state or locality an agent of the federal government. See Griggs v. Allegheny County, Pa., 369 U.S. 84, 89, 82 S.Ct. 531, 7 L.Ed.2d 585 (1962) (<HOLDING>); D.R. Smalley & Sons, Inc. v. United States,",Is there an agency relationship between the federal government and the State of California based on the facts of this case?,"To determine whether there is an agency relationship between the federal government and the State of California, we need to analyze the legal elements of agency as defined in the Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1(1). According to the Restatement, agency is the result of consent by one person for another to act on their behalf and subject to their control. In this case, there is no manifestation of consent by either the federal government or the State of California to create an agency relationship. The Supreme Court and the United States Court of Claims have both held that conditioning the receipt of federal funds on a state taking a particular action does not make the state or locality an agent of the federal government. Therefore, based on these precedents and the absence of consent or control, there is no agency relationship between the federal government and the State of California.","No, there is no agency relationship between the federal government and the State of California based on the facts of this case.

"Campbell argues that the, term “repair” as used in the limitation of liability clause encompasses diminished value. Urging that the term “repair” should not be interpreted narrowly to only cover physical repairs, Campbell states that “repair” should contemplate making the insured whole. Alternatively, Campbell argues that the language of the insurance policy is ambiguous. Campbell relies on a number of other states’ cases addressing first-party contract claims, wherein the courts have concluded |isthat coverage for diminished value is required either because of the plain meaning of the policy language or based on a finding that the language is ambiguous. Among the cases that Campbell cites are: MFA Ins. Co. v. Citizens National Bank of Hope, 260 Ark. 849, 545 S.W.2d 70 (1977), (<HOLDING>); Delledonne v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co.,","Does the term ""repair"" in the limitation of liability clause include diminished value according to Campbell's argument?","The question revolves around the interpretation of the term ""repair"" in the limitation of liability clause. Campbell argues that ""repair"" should not be narrowly interpreted to only cover physical repairs, but should encompass making the insured whole, which includes diminished value. Campbell further contends that the language of the insurance policy is ambiguous, citing cases from other states that have concluded that coverage for diminished value is required either based on the plain meaning of the policy language or due to ambiguity. One such case is MFA Ins. Co. v. Citizens National Bank of Hope. Therefore, in order to determine whether the term ""repair"" includes diminished value, it is necessary to analyze the language of the policy and consider the interpretation given by courts in cases with similar issues.","Whether the term ""repair"" in the limitation of liability clause includes diminished value depends on the interpretation of the insurance policy and whether the language is found to be ambiguous. According to Campbell's argument, ""repair"" should be construed broadly to encompass making the insured whole, which would include diminished value. This argument is supported by cases from other states, such as MFA Ins. Co. v. Citizens National Bank of Hope, where courts have concluded that coverage for diminished value is required either due to the plain meaning of the policy language or due to ambiguity. Ultimately, the question of whether diminished value is included in the term ""repair"" would require a thorough analysis of the insurance policy language and the interpretation provided by courts in relevant cases."
"Unionamerica Insurance Company Limited, and Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s, London subscribing to Lloyd’s Excess Liability Claims Made Policy No. N00060A96 — of the Missouri plaintiffs claim.

Before the Court is defendants’ Motion for Summary Judgment, which seeks the dismissal of Amtrak’s complaint on the ground that it failed to give timely notice of the Missouri case as required by each of the insurers’ policies. For the reasons below, the Court will grant defendants’ motion. BACKGROUND The facts underlying the present dispute are familiar and need not be repeated here, this being the third dispositive motion to have arisen from the parties’ disagreement regarding insurance coverage. See Amtrak, 365 F.3d at 1107 (<HOLDING>); Nat’l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Lexington Ins.",Did Amtrak give timely notice of the Missouri case as required by the insurers' policies?,"The issue at hand is whether Amtrak provided timely notice of the Missouri case as required by the insurers' policies. The insurers are seeking the dismissal of Amtrak's complaint based on their argument that Amtrak failed to give timely notice. The Court has previously addressed this dispute in two prior motions, indicating that the facts of the case are familiar to the Court. Given the insurers' motion for summary judgment, it can be inferred that they believe Amtrak did not comply with the notice requirements stated in the policies. Therefore, the Court will likely grant the defendants' motion, as failure to provide timely notice would result in non-compliance with the policies.","Yes, the Court is likely to grant the defendants' motion for summary judgment, indicating that Amtrak did not give timely notice of the Missouri case as required by the insurers' policies."
"compliment each other, but courts have found that in most cases they are so intertwined in the defendant’s argument that they appear to raise the same question: are the plaintiffs claims so “completely preempted” that the only way to avoid removal due to federal question jurisdiction is through the “artful pleading” of the state-law claim? Thus, these courts have viewed “complete preemption” as a prerequisite to the application of the “artful pleading doctrine”. See, Rivet, 522 U.S. at 475, 118 S.Ct. 921 (“The artful pleading doctrine allows removal where federal law completely preempts a plaintiffs state-law claim”); Braco v. MCI WorldCom Communications, Inc., 138 F.Supp.2d. 1260, 1268, n. 10 (C.D.Cal.2001); Crump v. WorldCom, Inc., 128 F.Supp.2d. 549, 559-60 (W.D.Tenn.2001)(<HOLDING>); Minnesota by Hatch, at 373. The instant","Is complete preemption a prerequisite for the application of the ""artful pleading doctrine"" in cases where plaintiffs' claims are intertwined with federal and state law?","The question at hand delves into the relationship between complete preemption and the ""artful pleading doctrine."" In many cases, courts have observed that the plaintiffs' claims are so intertwined with both federal and state law that they essentially raise the same question. When this occurs, courts have found that complete preemption becomes a prerequisite for the application of the ""artful pleading doctrine."" Complete preemption allows for removal of a case to federal court when federal law supersedes and preempts a plaintiff's state-law claim. It is through the ""artful pleading"" of a state-law claim that removal due to federal question jurisdiction can be avoided. The Supreme Court's decision in Rivet v. Regions Bank and other cases supports this notion, highlighting that the ""artful pleading doctrine"" operates when federal law completely preempts a plaintiff's state-law claim. Therefore, to apply the ""artful pleading doctrine,"" it is crucial to establish complete preemption in cases where plaintiffs' claims involve a combination of federal and state law.","Yes, complete preemption is a prerequisite for the application of the ""artful pleading doctrine"" in cases where the plaintiffs' claims are intertwined with federal and state law. The Court's decision in Rivet v. Regions Bank and other relevant cases have established that the ""artful pleading doctrine"" comes into play when federal law completely preempts a plaintiff's state-law claim."

In order for the defendants to claim qualified immunity, three elements need to be satisfied. First, Mocek must have been engaged in constitutionally protected activity. Filming at an airport security checkpoint falls within the ambit of First Amendment-protected activity. Second, the government's actions should have caused injury to Mocek. Arresting Mocek for exercising his right to film can be considered as causing injury. Lastly, the defendants can only claim qualified immunity if, at the time of the arrest, it was not clearly established that plaintiffs could maintain retaliation claims for arrests supported by probable cause. The McCormick v. City of Lawrence case establishes the requirement of a clearly established precedent. However, if there were prior cases or legal opinions that clearly established that retaliation claims for arrests supported by probable cause were permissible, the defendants cannot rely on qualified immunity.","Yes, the defendants can claim qualified immunity for arresting Mocek for filming at an airport security checkpoint if it was not clearly established at the time that plaintiffs could maintain retaliation claims for arrests supported by probable cause. The availability of qualified immunity is contingent on a lack of clearly established precedent supporting such retaliation claims."
"¶ 127.) The Complaints plausibly allege that a no-AG agreement is both very valuable to a generic manufacturer (and thus may induce it to stay out of the market) and amounts to a sacrifice by a brand manufacturer, rendering the potential anticompetitive effect plain.

See Aggrenox I, 94 F.Supp.3d at 245 (“If some particular transfer of money would be unlawful—for whatever reason— its unlawfulness is not cured merely because the value is transferred in the form of exclusive licenses instead of cash, irrespective of whether the grant of an exclusive license would otherwise be valid....

In previous cases such as Aggrenox I, the court held that the transfer of value, regardless of whether it is in the form of exclusive licenses or cash, can still be deemed unlawful if its purpose is to restrain competition. The form of payment is not the determining factor; rather, it is the intent behind the payment that matters. Other cases such as Lamictal and Opana support this reasoning. Therefore, on a motion to dismiss under 12(b)(6) standards, these allegations would be sufficient to establish the potential anticompetitive nature of a no-AG agreement.","Yes, a no-AG agreement between a brand manufacturer and a generic manufacturer can be considered anticompetitive and subject to legal challenge, as established in previous cases such as Aggrenox I, Lamictal, and Opana."
"some rational basis rather than be arbitrary and capricious). Petitioner’s prior escape, his history of attempted escapes, and possession of escape paraphernalia, guns and ammunition did provide a rational basis for initially placing him in CM status and for confining him there for some period of time. However, these violations are over ten years old, and petitioner has had only one minor disciplinary infraction since. Consequently, we believe a substantial question exists on whether the Assignment Team’s assessment that petitioner remains a severe escape risk provides a sufficient rational basis to support his continued confinement in CM in the absence of any reported objective evidence other than these ten-year old violations. B. Due Process Petitioner next asserts that hi ir.1981) (<HOLDING>) In Hewitt v.

Therefore, there is a substantial question regarding whether the Assignment Team's assessment that the petitioner remains a severe escape risk is supported by sufficient rational basis in the absence of any reported objective evidence other than the ten-year old violations. Upholding due process, the court in Hewitt v. Helms held that an inmate's continued confinement in administrative segregation requires periodic review and a rational basis.

"homestead exemption, even though the title of the property is held by a revocable trust. In the case at hand, Mary is the trustee and one of the beneficiaries of the Mary D. Fitton Revocable Trust.

The Supreme Court, in Usery v. Turner Elkhom Mining Co., established that such legislative acts come to the Court with a presumption of constitutionality. The burden rests on the party claiming a due process violation to demonstrate that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational manner. This principle was reaffirmed in Concrete Pipe and Products of California, Inc. v. Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California and Connolly v. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., where the Court upheld withdrawal liability and rejected substantive due process challenges. Hence, there exists a presumption of constitutionality for legislative acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life, placing the burden of proof on the party alleging a violation.","Yes, legislative acts adjusting the burdens and benefits of economic life come to the Court with a presumption of constitutionality, and the burden is on the party alleging a due process violation to establish that the legislature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.

The corresponding policy statement in the Sentencing Guidelines, specifically U.S.S.G. § 7B1.4 applic. note 6, states that the court shall consider these factors in the case of a defendant who fails a drug test. The court in United States v. Hancox determined that this provision applies when a defendant violates the terms of their supervised release. Additionally, United States v.

Therefore, if a defendant does not wish to enter a pretrial diversion program, they cannot be compelled to do so under Kentucky law. The Court of Appeals' decision in St. Clair v.

"examine and challenge all factual information upon which the court based his sentence."" Id. ¶ 9 It is proper for the trial court to impose restitution at sentencing unless defendant objects to its imposition and requests a full hearing on the amount at that time. See Utah Code Ann. § 76-3-201(4)(e) (1999); State v. Stayer, 706 P.2d 611, 612 (Utah 1985) (per curiam). In this regard, Utah Code Ann. § 76-8-201(4)(e) (1999) states: ""If the defendant objects to the imposition, amount, or distribution of the restitution, the court shall at the time of sentencing allow the defendant a full hearing on the issue."" Id. (emphasis added). Thus, the statute is clear-any request for a full restitution hearing must be made at or before sentencing. Cf. Monson v.

Furthermore, the statute clearly states that any request for a full restitution hearing must be made at or before sentencing. Therefore, if the defendant fails to object to the imposition or amount of the restitution and request a full hearing at or before the sentencing, they would not have the opportunity to request a hearing on the amount of restitution after the sentencing has already taken place. This interpretation is supported by the case of Monson v. Carver and State v.

"contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of [the contract containing the provision for arbitration].” 9 U.S.C. § 2 (emphasis added). The complaint describes a controversy that did not arise out of the termite agreement. In their brief to this Court, the Orkin defendants argue that “the fact that the termite [agreement] [was] entered into after the ‘termite letter’ [was] prepared is of no legal significance.” We disagree. The Orkin defendants cite no authority for such a broad interpretation of the “thereafter arising” language of § 2 of the FAA, and we know of no authority that could provide such a broad interpretation. It would be a strained reading of the FAA as well as circuitous log 1255, 1258 (9th Cir.1981) (<HOLDING>). In the present action, the Lar-kins claim",Can the arbitration provision in the contract be applied to the controversy described in the complaint?,"The question revolves around the application of the arbitration provision in the contract to the controversy described in the complaint. According to the language of the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) in section 2, the provision applies to a controversy arising out of the contract containing the arbitration provision. In this case, the complaint describes a controversy that did not arise out of the termite agreement itself. The Orkin defendants' argument that the timing of the termite agreement is of no legal significance is unsupported and lacks any authority. The court in Circuit City Stores v. Adams established that the ""thereafter arising"" language in the FAA should be interpreted narrowly. Therefore, it would be a strained interpretation of the FAA to apply the arbitration provision to the controversy in the present case, as it did not directly arise from the termite agreement.","No, the arbitration provision in the contract cannot be applied to the controversy described in the complaint, as it did not directly arise out of the termite agreement, as established in the Circuit City Stores v.

In the Kearley v. Kearley case, the court concluded that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding the appellee $1400 per month in alimony because there was no competent, substantial evidence to support the appellee's determination of the former husband's ability to pay. The court relied on the financial affidavit, which showed the former husband's monthly net income and deducted his average monthly expenses, including the $1400 alimony, resulting in a deficiency. Based on this reasoning, the trial court's acceptance and adoption of the magistrate's recommended order without sufficient evidence to support the former husband's ability to pay would be an abuse of discretion. The McCann v. Crumblish-McCann and Hotaling v.

In the case of Fishman v. Delta Air Lines, Inc., the application of an excessively hot compress for ear pain relief, which is a routine procedure, was considered an accident. Similarly, in Fulop v. Malev Hungarian Airlines, the failure to divert a plane despite awareness of risks was also classified as an accident.

Pruitt, 487 F.2d 1241, 1244 (8th Cir.1973). Any possession or distribution outside of the legitimate distribution chain is unlawful. United States v. Vamos, 797 F.2d 1146, 1151-52 (2d Cir.1986). Thus, if the possession is not in the “usual course of the registrant’s lawful professional practice,” then it is not in the legitimate chain of possession and therefore not within the § 822(c) exception.

"recommendations respecting plan administration is not indicative of fiduciary status. Toomey, 855 F.Supp. at 24; 29 C.F.R. § 2509.75-8(D-2). The Court concludes, therefore, that John Hancock’s performance of plan design services lacks the discretionary authority in the administration of an employee benefit plan necessary to qualify it as a fiduciary under ERISA. Turning to an analysis of the other services John Hancock provides to the Plan, the Court recognizes that urging the purchase of an insurance company’s plan services does not make that company a fiduciary with respect to those services. American Fed’n of Unions v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc’y, 841 F.2d 658, 664 (5th Cir.1988); see also Consolidated Beef Indus. v. New York Life Ins.

Additionally, the court in American Fed’n of Unions v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc’y clarified that urging the purchase of plan services from an insurance company does not confer fiduciary status on that company. Therefore, based on these legal precedents, John Hancock's provision of plan design services and urging the purchase of insurance plan services does not make them a fiduciary under ERISA.","No, John Hancock cannot be considered a fiduciary under ERISA based on their provision of plan design services and urging the purchase of an insurance company's plan services, as established in Toomey v.

However, the court concluded that the petitioner failed to establish past persecution because he did not provide any evidence of physical injury resulting from the treatment he faced. The absence of physical harm led the court to determine that a five-day detention without harm does not necessarily constitute past persecution. This reasoning aligns with the principle that not all exceptional treatment amounts to persecution. Therefore, based on the court's decision in Zheng v. United States Att'y Gen., the petitioner in that case would not be able to establish a claim of past persecution.","No, the petitioner in Zheng v.

"or desire,” which might weigh in favor of construing a waiver narrowly, but rather by the “need to avoid inconsistency, anomaly, and unfairness,” which requires a general assessment of the equities associated with the state’s participation in the bankruptcy litigation. Lapides, 535 U.S. at 620, 122 S.Ct. 1640. As discussed above, the balance of these equities favors a construction of the Eleventh Amendment that would permit a debtor to assert a permissive counterclaim capped by a setoff limitation against a state that has filed a proof of claim. Second, the Supreme Court developed the “narrow construction” rule as a means of interpreting a state’s “unequivocal expression” of waiver in state statutes, state constitutions, and the like. Nordic Vill., 503 U.S. at 34, 112 S.Ct. 1011 (<HOLDING>) (internal quotation marks omitted); see, e.g.,",Can a debtor assert a permissive counterclaim with a setoff limitation against a state that has filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy litigation?,"The question centers around the issue of whether a debtor can assert a permissive counterclaim with a setoff limitation against a state that has filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy litigation.

This requires a general assessment of the equities associated with the state's participation in the bankruptcy litigation. In Nordic Vill., the Supreme Court applied a ""narrow construction"" rule, which means that a state's waiver of immunity must be an unequivocal expression in state statutes, state constitutions, or similar legal instruments. Based on these principles, it can be argued that a debtor should be allowed to assert a permissive counterclaim with a setoff limitation against a state that has filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy litigation, as long as the equities favor such a construction and the state has provided an unequivocal expression of waiver.","Yes, a debtor can assert a permissive counterclaim with a setoff limitation against a state that has filed a proof of claim in bankruptcy litigation, provided that the equities favor such a construction and the state has unequivocally waived its sovereign immunity, as established in Lapides v.

Mere allegations that statements in an earlier report should have been made in subsequent reports do not constitute a claim of securities fraud. Therefore, if the statement made by the defendants about the potential negative impact of new therapies was merely a ""benign reference"" and subsequent SEC filings addressed the competitive potential of the new therapies more thoroughly, it cannot be considered inadequate warning.","No, the plaintiffs were adequately warned about the potential impact of new therapies on the sales of flea and tick products, as per the ruling in Acito v.

"relied upon does not support a removal.” Id. To establish an affirmative defense of disability discrimination due to alcoholism, an appellant must show (1) “he suffers from an addiction,” and (2) “that the addiction caused the misconduct.” Avant v.

Mr. Wyrick did not provide any evidence regarding his alcohol addiction or any treatment and that, even if he had, mitigation due to alcoholism is “outweighed by the seriousness of the offenses in relation to [Mr. Wyrick’s] position, his prior disciplinary record, and the fact that there is no reason to conclude that [Mr. Wyrick’s] failure to be fully truthful was caused by his use of alcohol.” Resp’t’s App. 42; see Huettner v.

To establish this defense, Mr. Wyrick must demonstrate two things: (1) that he suffers from an addiction to alcohol, and (2) that this addiction caused the misconduct in question. The AJ, in this case, determined that Mr. Wyrick failed to provide any evidence regarding his alcohol addiction or any treatment. Furthermore, the AJ concluded that even if Mr. Wyrick had provided such evidence, the mitigation due to alcoholism would be outweighed by the seriousness of the offenses, his prior disciplinary record, and the absence of any indication that his lack of truthfulness was a result of his alcohol use. This conclusion aligns with the holding in the Huettner v. Dep't of the Army case, which supports the idea that alcoholism cannot be used as a defense if the misconduct is severe and unrelated to the effects of alcohol.","No, Mr. Wyrick cannot establish an affirmative defense of disability discrimination due to alcoholism in his case, as he failed to provide evidence of his alcohol addiction and there is no indication that his misconduct was caused by his use of alcohol.

"sold two copies of the video to residents of Puerto Rico through the mail, and 2) Defendant sold 20 subscriptions to its magazine in Puerto Rico, in which they advertised the sale of the video. Defendant argues that LNE’s sale of two videos in Puerto Rico — one of which was purchased by Plaintiff Aníbal Agos-to — cannot logically be considered the legal or “proximate” cause of Plaintiffs’ alleged injuries since they were not a substantial factor in the sequence of events that led to the claimed injury.

"by the Supreme Court of the United States from all such final decisions.” Id. It is in light of this historic and statutory backdrop that we must consider the nature of our review of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands’ decisions. At the outset, we identify three possible standards of review that we might apply to a decision of the Virgin Islands Supreme Court. First, we might define our role as that of a “super-Supreme Court,” with powers of review equivalent to that of a state Supreme Court reviewing the decision of an intermediary state appellate court. Second, our role might be framed as equivalent to that of the United States Supreme Court when it reviews decisions of a state Supreme Court. See, e.g., Oregon v. Guzek, 546 U.S. 517, 521, 126 S.Ct. 1226, 163 L.Ed.2d 1112 (2006) (<HOLDING>); Richfield Oil Corp. v. State Bd. of",What standard of review should be applied when reviewing decisions of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands?,"The question pertains to the standard of review for decisions of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands. There are three possible standards that could be applied. Firstly, the standard could be similar to that of a state Supreme Court reviewing the decision of an intermediate state appellate court, where we act as a ""super-Supreme Court"" with equivalent powers of review. Alternatively, our role could be framed as equivalent to that of the United States Supreme Court when it reviews decisions of a state Supreme Court. Lastly, the standard could be a deferential one, where we give considerable weight to the Virgin Islands Supreme Court's interpretation and ruling, only reversing if there is a clear error of law or abuse of discretion. Considering the historic and statutory backdrop, it is important to carefully determine the appropriate standard of review.","The standard of review to be applied when reviewing decisions of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands depends on three possible options: acting as a ""super-Supreme Court"" with equivalent powers of review to that of a state Supreme Court, adopting a standard similar to the review of decisions of a state Supreme Court by the United States Supreme Court, or applying a deferential standard that gives considerable weight to the Virgin Islands Supreme Court's interpretation and ruling. The determination of the appropriate standard depends on a thorough examination of the historic and statutory context."
"opinions.... ” We have no trouble concluding that Rule 703 encompasses hearsay statements in a context such as the instant one, where the government expert specifically testified that his opinion was based on his experience and expertise, in conjunction with the information he received from a DEA intelligence agent and Bermudan authorities, and that such sources of information were regularly relied upon in valuating narcotics. See also 2A Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 455 (3d ed. 2000) (stating that “expert testimony, based in part upon reports of others that are not in evidence but of a sort the expert customarily relies upon in the practice of his profession, are [sic] admissible”); cf. United States v. Floyd, 281 F.3d 1346 (11th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). Further, even before the enactment of Federal",Can hearsay statements be included as part of an expert's opinion in court?,"The question concerns the admissibility of hearsay statements in expert testimony. Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence states that an expert may base their opinion on facts or data that are not admissible in evidence if those facts or data are of a type reasonably relied upon by experts in the field. This means that hearsay statements can be included as part of an expert's opinion if they are based on the expert's experience, expertise, and information received from reliable sources that are regularly relied upon in the field. The case of United States v. Floyd further supports this reasoning by upholding the inclusion of hearsay in an expert's opinion.","Yes, hearsay statements can be included as part of an expert's opinion in court if they are based on the expert's experience, expertise, and information received from reliable sources that are commonly relied upon in the field, as stated in Rule 703 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The case of United States v. Floyd also supports the admissibility of hearsay in expert testimony."
"his official conduct unless he proves that the statement was made with actual malice. Actual malice means knowledge of, or reckless disregard for, the falsify of a statement. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 279-80, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 706 (1964). Lawyers who make derogatory remarks about judges are similarly protected from civil or criminal liability unless actual malice is shown. Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S. 64, 74, 13 L. Ed. 2d 125, 132 (1964). However, these principles only offer immunity from a civil suit for damages, not from other forms of discipline. Imbler v. Pachtman, 424 U.S. 409, 428-29, 47 L. Ed. 2d 128, 142 (1976). The First Amendment does not afford protection to the utterer for all statements made. See e.g. Spivey, 345 N.C. at 414-15, 480 S.E.2d at 698-99 (<HOLDING>). Judge Hobgood’s order contained the following",Can lawyers be held liable for making derogatory remarks about judges?,"The question pertains to the liability of lawyers for derogatory remarks made about judges. According to the principles established in Garrison v. Louisiana, lawyers are protected from civil and criminal liability unless actual malice is proven. Actual malice refers to knowledge of, or reckless disregard for, the falsity of a statement. However, this immunity only applies to civil suits for damages and does not protect lawyers from other forms of discipline, as stated in Imbler v. Pachtman. The First Amendment does not provide blanket protection for all statements made, as mentioned in Spivey. Therefore, while lawyers may have some protection, they can still face consequences for derogatory remarks about judges.","Lawyers may have limited protection from civil and criminal liability for derogatory remarks made about judges if they can establish that the remarks were not made with actual malice. However, this protection does not shield them from other forms of discipline, and the First Amendment does not offer complete immunity for all statements made."
"under 18 U.S.C. § 1593 for considerable, involuntary time and expense resulting from the need to respond to frivolous and unauthorized actions of the Defendant in the mis-enforcement of the internal revenue laws of the federal United States. Id. at ¶ 6.3.1. See also Brief, at pp. 15-17 (further detailing the “History of of Interaction With Defendant(s) and Their Employer”). Under similar facts, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Atkinson v. O’Neill, 867 F.2d 589, 590 (10th Cir.1989), that “[w]hen an action is one against named individual defendants, but the acts complained of consist of actions taken by defendants in their official capacity as agents of the United States, the action is in fact one against the United States.” Accord Burgos v. Milton, 709 F.2d 1 (1st Cir.1983) (<HOLDING>). Insofar as the Petition may be read to assert",Can the Plaintiff recover for the time and expense they incurred due to the Defendant's unauthorized actions in mis-enforcing the internal revenue laws of the federal United States?,"The question involves the issue of whether the Plaintiff can recover for the time and expense they suffered as a result of the Defendant's unauthorized actions. In Atkinson v. O'Neill, the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals held that when individual defendants are named in an action but the acts complained of were carried out by them in their official capacity as agents of the United States, the action is essentially one against the United States. This ruling establishes the principle that the United States can be held responsible for the actions of its agents in such cases. Additionally, the First Circuit Court of Appeals case Burgos v. Milton supports this reasoning. Therefore, based on these precedents, it is likely that the Plaintiff can recover for the time and expense they incurred due to the Defendant's unauthorized actions in mis-enforcing the internal revenue laws of the federal United States.","Yes, the Plaintiff can likely recover for the time and expense they incurred as a result of the Defendant's unauthorized actions in mis-enforcing the internal revenue laws of the federal United States, based on the Atkinson v.

"second suit must be identical with the prior action in four respects: 1) the parties must be the same or in privity; 2) the subject matter must be identical; 3) the capacity or character of persons for or against whom the claim is made must be the same; and 4) the same cause of action must be involved in both suits.

In the case of South Dakota v. Smith, the Supreme Court stated that unless there is a constitutional prohibition, the federal government has the authority to establish the terms and conditions under which its monetary allotments to states will be disbursed. However, for Congress to impose such conditions, it must do so clearly and unambiguously. If a state accepts federal funding while being aware of and knowingly accepting the conditions attached to it, these conditions become enforceable obligations on the states. This was established in the cases of Wheeler v. Barrera and King v. Smith. Therefore, the federal government can impose conditions on the funding it provides to states, as long as these conditions are clearly communicated and the states accept them knowingly.","Yes, the federal government can impose conditions on the funding it provides to states, as established in South Dakota v.

"unconstitutional as violative of his right to equal protection. After careful consideration, for substantially the same reasons stated in the district court's March 13, 2003 order, we `conclude that the district court did' not err in holding that Mr. Latu suffered no prejudice from the defects in the notice. The defects were cor rected and Mr. Latu was given all the time he needed to meet the charges. We reject Mr. Latu’s argument that, because the initial notice was defective, the attorney general’s subsequent acts in effecting his removal were ultra vires.

The argument presented by Mr. Latu, claiming that the subsequent acts of the attorney general in effecting his removal were ultra vires due to the initial defective notice, is rejected. It is established that an official act does not become ultra vires if the officer was legally empowered to act, even if there may have been an error in the process. This is supported by the case of Wyoming v. United States. Therefore, it can be concluded that Mr. Latu's right to equal protection was not violated as he received all the due process.","No, Mr. Latu's right to equal protection was not violated despite defects in the notice of his removal, as determined by the district court's order and the legal principle that an official act does not become ultra vires if the officer was empowered to act, as established in the case Wyoming v.

To support this argument, Wood draws parallels to other entities like Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, the American National Red Cross, and Amtrak, which were created by the federal government and chartered under state or District of Columbia law, but have been deemed or observed as not being part of the government for certain purposes in court cases. Ralis v. RFE/RL, Inc. and Marcella v. Brandywine Hosp. are cited as examples where similar entities were not considered part of the government.

No different conclusion is warranted by § 101’s definition of a “useful article” as one having an intrinsic utilitarian function “that is not merely to portray the appearance of the article or to convey information.” Although Jovani argues that a decoration on a dress necessarily “portrays the appearance” of the dress and, therefore, is outside the scope of usefulness, we have construed this statutory phrase more narrowly to identify only a small category of items whose sole usefulness resides in their appearance. See Hart v. Dan Chase Taxidermy Supply Co., 86 F.3d 320, 323 (2d Cir.1996) (<HOLDING>); accord Chosun Int’l Inc. v.

However, upon examination of the transcript, it is clear that Meserve's attorney objected as soon as it was evident that the government's questioning was in violation of Rule 609. The attorney objected specifically when the government indicated that the conviction they were asking about was a twenty-year-old disorderly conduct conviction.

While plaintiffs are correct that “conspiracy is a matter of inference,” summary judgment may still be appropriate on a conspiracy claim where the nonmoving party rests merely on conclusory allegations. Here plaintiffs have presented no evidence, either direct or circumstantial of an agreement among defendants from which a reasonable jury could have inferred a conspiracy among them to inflict harm upon the plaintiffs. Earle, 850 F.2d at 845; see also Slotnick v. Staviskey, 560 F.2d 31, 33 (1st Cir.1977)(<HOLDING>).

In the present case, the plaintiffs have failed to provide any direct or circumstantial evidence that could reasonably lead a jury to infer a conspiracy among the defendants.

"inland wetlands agencies have not been found to be quasi-municipal entities. See Denehy v. Inland Wetlands & Watercourses Comm’n, No. CV940704881 S, 1994 WL 247903, *2 (ConmSuper. May 27, 1994) (unpublished) (finding in an action relating to an administrative appeal that, “The Agency is not a municipal or quasi-municipal corporation so as to allow service upon its presiding officer or managing agent”). The court does pause, however, in light of a recent case decided by another court in this district. In Arrigoni Enterprises, LLC v. Town of Durham, No. 3:08-CV-520, 2011 WL 4572025 (D.Conn. Sept. 30, 2011), the court held that a municipal planning and zoning commission and a municipal zoning board of appeals were proper defendants in a section 1983 action. Arrigoni, 2011 WL 4572025 at *8 (<HOLDING>). The court in Arrigoni relied on a Connecticut",Can a municipal wetlands agency be considered a quasi-municipal entity?,"The question pertains to the classification of inland wetlands agencies as quasi-municipal entities. In the case of Denehy v. Inland Wetlands & Watercourses Comm'n, the court determined that these agencies do not hold the status of municipal or quasi-municipal corporations, thereby negating the option of serving their presiding officer or managing agent. Although, in a recent case, Arrigoni Enterprises, LLC v. Town of Durham, a court in the same district ruled that a municipal planning and zoning commission, as well as a municipal zoning board of appeals, could be defendants in a section 1983 action, indicating a contrasting perspective. However, it remains necessary to assess the application of this ruling to the classification of inland wetlands agencies.","It is uncertain whether inland wetlands agencies can be deemed quasi-municipal entities due to inconsistent court decisions in the district. While the Denehy case asserted that these agencies lack the status of municipal or quasi-municipal corporations, the Arrigoni Enterprises case presented a differing viewpoint by permitting certain municipal bodies to be defendants. Thus, further analysis is needed to determine the exact classification of inland wetlands agencies."
"at 7. In the absence of that certification, the Court has little difficulty concluding that the complaint was not served, and that in consequence, Plaintiff has not satisfied the requirement of Rule 25(a)(3) to serve the motion to substitute “on nonparties as provided in Rule 4.” Id.

United States, 208 F.R.D. at 31-32 (stating “non-party successors or representatives of the deceased party must be served the suggestion of death in the manner provided by Rule 4 for the service of a summons” (citation and quotation marks omitted)). It is axiomatic that a court lacks personal jurisdiction over a would-be party that has not been “served with a copy of the complaint.” Fed.R.Civ.P. 4(c)(1); see Ayres v.

As per Rule 25(a)(3), the motion to substitute, along with the suggestion of death, must be served on nonparties in the manner provided by Rule 4. Failure to serve the suggestion of death on nonparties would result in the court lacking personal jurisdiction over them. This is supported by the case of George v.

Therefore, if the suggestion of death has not been properly served on the non-party successor or representative, the court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over them.","No, the court cannot exercise personal jurisdiction over a non-party successor or representative of a deceased party if the suggestion of death has not been served on them in accordance with Rule 4, as stated in the George v.

The analysis of the constitutionality of section 78-3-31 begins with the understanding that statutory provisions must be reviewed in order to establish their constitutionality. Previous Utah cases such as In re Criminal Investigation, Wells v. Children's Aid Soc'y of Utah, and Ellis v. Social Servs. Dep't of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have set precedents in which statutes were evaluated for their constitutionality.

Furthermore, the court in State v. Mayfield explains that the failure to exercise discretion or make a record reflecting an exercise of discretion can be an error under certain circumstances. Hence, if the trial court's decision in this case stemmed from a mistaken legal premise or if it failed to exercise discretion or make a record reflecting an exercise of discretion, it would not fall within the range of legally correct choices or produce a legally correct outcome.","Whether the trial court abused its discretion in making its decision depends on whether its decision falls within the range of legally correct choices and produces a permissible, legally correct outcome.

"(V.I. 2008)). Having reviewed the magistrate’s order and the record, we agree with the Superior Court that the magistrate did not commit clear error in his determination of actual notice. To show that the opposing party received actual notice, a party is not required to prove that any particular form, such as personal service by a process server or service by mail, was used. See Tulsa, 485 U.S. at 491 (permitting actual notice to be given by “ ‘mail or other means as certain to ensure actual notice.’ ”) (quoting Mennonite, 462 U.S. at 800). In the present context, the critical issue under Tulsa is whether or not the claimants had actual knowledge of the creation and pendency of the estate, not the form the notice took. See In re Estate of Sheridan, 117 P.3d 39, 41 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004) (<HOLDING>). The magistrate rested his determination that",Is it necessary to prove that a specific form of notice was used to demonstrate that the opposing party received actual notice?,"The question pertains to the requirement of proving a specific form of notice for demonstrating actual notice. In Tulsa v. United States, the Supreme Court established that actual notice can be given through any means that ensures the opposing party has received it. It does not mandate the use of any particular form, such as personal service or service by mail. The critical factor, as stated in In re Estate of Sheridan, is whether the claimants had actual knowledge of the creation and pendency of the estate, not the form of notice. Therefore, proving a specific form of notice is not necessary to demonstrate actual notice.","No, it is not necessary to prove that a specific form of notice was used to demonstrate that the opposing party received actual notice, as established in Tulsa v.

"a separate motion. 7 . In referring to aliens entitled to voluntary departure as “favored,” we follow the same characterization as used by the Supreme Court in Dada which stated, “We must be reluctant to assume that the voluntary departure statute was designed to remove this important safeguard [motion to reopen] for the distinct class of deportable aliens most favored by the same law.” Dada, 554 U.S. at 18, 128 S.Ct. 2307. 8 . This case is distinguishable from cases where the alien filed a motion to reopen during the seven-month window, but explicitly requested a stay of the voluntary departure period pending adjudication of the motion indicating that the alien had no intention to relinquish the voluntary departure agreement. See Blackman v. Att'y Gen., 414 Fed.Appx. 415 (3d Cir.2011) (<HOLDING>); see also Ramirez-Mena v. Holder, 324",Can an alien who is entitled to voluntary departure file a motion to reopen their case?,"The question pertains to whether an alien who is eligible for voluntary departure can file a motion to reopen their case. In the case of Dada, the Supreme Court referred to aliens entitled to voluntary departure as ""favored"", suggesting that the voluntary departure statute was not intended to remove important safeguards like the ability to file a motion to reopen. However, it is important to note that this case is different from situations where the alien explicitly requests a stay of the voluntary departure period pending the adjudication of the motion, demonstrating their intention to retain the voluntary departure agreement. Therefore, an alien entitled to voluntary departure may file a motion to reopen their case, as long as they do not explicitly indicate an intention to relinquish the voluntary departure agreement.","Yes, an alien who is entitled to voluntary departure may file a motion to reopen their case, provided that they do not express their intention to relinquish the voluntary departure agreement."

In the case cited, Miles, the Court acknowledged that admiralty courts should refer to legislative enactments for guidance on policy, but in situations where Congress has not specifically acted, the Court maintains the responsibility to fashion controlling rules and remedies in maritime law. The Court rejected the argument that remedies should be treated as solely a congressional matter, emphasizing that the absence of specific Congressional action does not limit the Court's power to establish rules and remedies in maritime law. Therefore, admiralty courts can indeed fashion controlling rules and remedies in maritime law in the absence of specific legislation.","Yes, admiralty courts have the authority to fashion controlling rules and remedies in maritime law if Congress has not specifically acted, as stated in the Miles case."

First, they calculate the lodestar, which is the number of hours reasonably expended by the attorney multiplied by a reasonable hourly rate. The reasonable hourly rate is determined by considering factors such as the attorney's skill, experience, reputation, and the prevailing market rate for similar services. Second, the court may then adjust the lodestar amount based on various factors such as the results obtained, the complexity of the case, and the attorney's performance. The court's decision in Loranger v. Stierheim and Moton v.

The plaintiffs’ second claim of political discrimination was tried before a jury from December 2-23, 2002, along with the damages phase of their due process claim. Ultimately, the jury rendered a verdict against plaintiffs, finding that defendants had not dismissed plaintiffs based on political grounds, and also awarding zero damages for the defendants’ violation of plaintiffs’ due process rights. See Verdict Forms (Docket Nos. 119-150). Notwithstanding, the Court upon entering judgment, awarded each plaintiff one dollar ($1.00) as nominal compensation for their due process claim.

The reasoning behind this is that when a defendant chooses to absent themselves from the jurisdiction during the appeal, they forfeit their right to appellate review.

The appellant argues that a farm tractor is a dangerous instrumentality because the legislature defines a farm tractor as a “motor vehicle” and extensively regulates their use. This argument is without merit. Although a farm tractor meets the statutory definition of a “motor vehicle,” at least three of our sister courts have held that statutory definitions of “motor vehicle” are not controlling in determining whether a device is a dangerous instrumentality. See §§ 316.003(12) & 322.01(19), Fla. Stat. (2008); Festival Fun Parks, LLC v. Gooch, 904 So.2d 542, 545-46 (Fla. 4th DCA 2005) (<HOLDING>); Edwards v. ABC Transp.

Additionally, the Brand X ruling introduces an additional question, which is whether the Supreme Court held that its interpretation of a key phrase in the statute is the only permissible reading. However, the trial court in the Swallows Holding, Ltd. v. Commissioner case, expressed caution in deciding what level of deference should be given to a regulation. Therefore, in light of these rulings and the cautious approach taken by the trial court, it is advisable to consider legislative history in determining the meaning of a statute.","Yes, legislative history can be considered in determining the meaning of a statute, as allowed by the Chevron ruling, and considering the additional question introduced by the Brand X ruling.

As of the October 1,1993 assessment date, the parish property was used by both the Archdiocese and the East Orange Board of Education. The Archdiocese offered weekly Mass, and held deanery meetings in the church rectory. Additionally, religious artifacts and furnishings were stored for safekeeping. The East Orange Board of Education rented space for classes on what is now Lot 2, and eventually acquired the lot following a subdivision in December 1994.

In the case of The Latter Day Saints v.

In this case, as of the October 1, 1993 assessment date, both the Archdiocese and the East Orange Board of Education made use of the property in question. The Archdiocese conducted weekly Mass, held meetings, and stored religious artifacts, while the Board of Education rented space for classes. Since there is no indication of conflict or legal violation, it can be inferred that both entities were allowed to use the parish property. The subsequent maintenance of these activities on the October 1, 1994 and October 1, 1995 assessment dates further supports this notion.","Yes, both the Archdiocese and the East Orange Board of Education can use the parish property at Block 151, Lots 1.01, 3, and 49 on the tax map of the City of East Orange, as long as their respective uses of the property do not conflict and are in compliance with any zoning or legal restrictions.

Even if Witter could prove that his creditors “pressured” him into entering the agreement with Dornier in order to obtain favorable financial treatment, these actions would not, as a matter of law, constitute legal duress. There is no allegation by Witter that his creditors’ actions were unjust or unfounded in any way. Further, the emotional strain Witter may have experienced from his divorce is also insufficient to establish legal duress. See Adams v. Adams, 503 So.2d 1052, 1057 (La.App.2d Cir.1987) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, there is no material issue of fact",Can Witter claim legal duress against his creditors for pressuring him into entering the agreement with Dornier?,"The question here revolves around whether Witter can claim legal duress against his creditors for pressuring him into entering the agreement with Dornier. In Louisiana, the standard for evaluating a claim of duress is subjective. In the case of Eymard v. Terrebonne, the court established that the fear must be reasonable and of unjust and considerable injury to one's person, property, or reputation. However, even if Witter can prove that his creditors pressured him into the agreement to obtain favorable financial treatment, these actions alone would not constitute legal duress unless there is an allegation that the creditors' actions were unjust or unfounded. Additionally, the emotional strain experienced from divorce, even if significant, is insufficient to establish legal duress, as stated in the Adams v. Adams case. Therefore, based on the absence of any allegations of unjust actions by the creditors or sufficient basis for legal duress, there is no material issue of fact supporting Witter's claim.","No, Witter cannot claim legal duress against his creditors for pressuring him into entering the agreement with Dornier since there are no allegations of unjust actions by the creditors or sufficient basis for legal duress, as established by the subjective standard in Louisiana law and relevant case law."

Schaff v. Kennelly, 69 N.W.2d 777, 779-80 (N.D.1955).

"notion that charter counties possess wide authority under Missouri Constitution Article VI, Section 18(c), to regulate municipal functions as they see fit — even in contravention of state statutes concerning the same powers. See, e.g., Casper v. Hetlage, 359 S.W.2d 781 (Mo.1962). So if section 260.247 in fact regulates a “municipal function,” serving in effect as a default regulation for political subdivisions which do not have home rule, the County is constitutionally free to exercise legislative power over that function; but if section 260.247 is “within the province of general legislation involving the public policy of the state as a whole,” then the County is bound by it regardless of its charter status. See State ex rel. St. Louis County v. Edwards, 589 S.W.2d 283, 286 (Mo.1979) (<HOLDING>). To resolve this question, the trial court",Can charter counties in Missouri regulate municipal functions in contravention of state statutes?,"The question revolves around the authority of charter counties in Missouri to regulate municipal functions contrary to state statutes. Casper v. Hetlage established the principle that charter counties have broad authority, as outlined in the Missouri Constitution Article VI, Section 18(c), to regulate municipal functions as they deem appropriate, even if it contradicts state statutes governing the same powers. However, for section 260.247 to be considered a ""municipal function"" and subject to charter county regulation, it must serve as a default regulation for political subdivisions without home rule. On the other hand, if section 260.247 falls within the scope of general legislation concerning the public policy of the state as a whole, then the County is bound by it, regardless of its charter status. State ex rel. St. Louis County v. Edwards supports this qualitative distinction. Therefore, the determination of whether charter counties can regulate municipal functions in contravention of state statutes depends on whether the specific function is considered a municipal function or falls under the province of general legislation involving the public policy of the state as a whole.","The authority of charter counties in Missouri to regulate municipal functions in contravention of state statutes depends on whether the function in question is classified as a municipal function and falls under the purview of general legislation involving the public policy of the state as a whole.

As explained by the Supreme Court in Ohio Forestry and Nat’l Park Hospitality Ass’n v. Dep’t of Interior, these adverse effects are of a strictly legal kind.

"CURIAM. The State appeals the trial court’s order withholding adjudication on Andrew Joseph Foster’s first-degree felony conviction.

See § 402.302, Fla. Stat. (2010). Commendably, Foster concedes error, based upon the plain language of section 775.08435(l)(a), Florida Statutes (2012), which prohibits a court from withholding an adjudication of guilt upon a defendant who commits a first-degree felony, and State v. Joseph, 995 So.2d 1182 (Fla. 2nd DCA 2008) (<HOLDING>). See also State v.

Section 775.08435(l)(a) of the Florida Statutes clearly states that a court is prohibited from withholding adjudication of guilt for a defendant who commits a first-degree felony. This is supported by the case of State v. Joseph, where the Second District Court of Appeal held that the plain language of the statute does not allow for the withholding of adjudication for a first-degree felony. Therefore, based on the law and the precedent set by the Joseph case, the trial court does not have the authority to withhold adjudication on Foster's first-degree felony conviction.","No, the trial court cannot withhold adjudication on Andrew Joseph Foster's first-degree felony conviction, as stated in the plain language of section 775.08435(l)(a) of the Florida Statutes and supported by the holding in State v.

It is important to note that exhaustion is not necessary when the educational issues at the heart of the dispute have already been resolved, as seen in Witte.

"against an unreasonably excessive use of deadly force in the form of Quando, a police canine.

City of Oakland, 145 F.3d 1087,","Could the use of excessive force in the form of a police canine, in addition to other physical assaults on the suspect, be considered unreasonable?","The question pertains to the reasonableness of using excessive force, specifically in relation to a police canine named Quando. The totality of force used against the suspect, including four blasts of pepper spray, slamming the suspect onto the porch, dragging him face down off the porch, ordering the canine to attack three times, and the resulting dog bites and physical assaults, could be deemed unreasonable by a jury. Previous cases, such as Santos and Headwaters Forest Defense v. County of Humboldt, have established that even the use of lesser force can be considered excessive when it is deemed unreasonable in the given circumstances. Therefore, considering the extent and nature of the force used in this case, it is possible for a jury to conclude that the use of excessive force, including the deployment of the police canine, was unreasonable.","Yes, a jury could find that the use of excessive force, which includes the deployment of a police canine and other physical assaults, could be considered unreasonable based on the totality of force used in the given circumstances."
"sovereignty interest, and lawsuit seeking recertification of state property tax assessment was fully as intrusive as retroactive money judgment).

In two other decisions, however, the Sixth",Can the Coeur d'Alene ruling be extended to every case involving a state property interest?,"The question pertains to the extension of the Coeur d'Alene ruling to all cases involving state property interests. In previous cases, courts have declined to extend the Coeur d'Alene ruling universally. For example, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in the Arnett v. Myers case determined that Coeur d'Alene does not apply to every case involving state property interests, specifically noting that the state's interest in the regulation of riparian rights does not implicate Coeur d'Alene unless the case seeks to quiet title. The Hamilton v. Myers case affirmed this position. Furthermore, the Sixth Circuit has ruled that Coeur d'Alene does not apply to claims for prospective relief brought under federal anti-discrimination laws, as seen in the Carten v. Kent State Univ. case. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Coeur d'Alene ruling cannot be extended to every case involving a state property interest.","No, the Coeur d'Alene ruling cannot be extended to every case involving a state property interest, as established in the Arnett v.

"deserve deference. Ornelas, 517 U.S. at 699-700, 116 S.Ct. 1657. However, although we review the district court’s findings of fact only for clear error, our review of the district court’s probable cause determination is de novo. Id. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657. Mr. Brown’s primary argument is that the officers lacked probable cause because they confronted him, not on the basis of “reasonably trustworthy” information, but on the basis of information obtained from an “informant,” Dill, whose credibility was previously unknown to the police. Mr. Brown rests this argument on cases holding that information from anonymous sources might not be sufficiently reliable to constitute probable cause for arrest. See, e.g., Florida v. J.L., 529 U.S. 266, 274, 120 S.Ct. 1375, 146 L.Ed.2d 254 (2000) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

In this case, Mr. Brown argues that the officers lacked probable cause because they relied on information from an informant whose credibility was previously unknown to the police. The Supreme Court has held that information from anonymous sources may not be considered sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause for arrest. This precedent is demonstrated in the Florida v. J.L. and United States v. Roberson cases. However, in the Ornelas v. United States case, it was established that the determination of probable cause is subject to de novo review. While the district court's findings of fact are reviewed for clear error, the probable cause determination itself is subject to independent evaluation. Therefore, in evaluating whether the officers had probable cause to confront Mr. Brown, the court would consider the reliability of the information provided by the informant and assess whether it met the standard of ""reasonably trustworthy"" information.","The determination of whether the officers had probable cause to confront Mr. Brown based on the information provided by the informant would depend on the court's assessment of the reliability and trustworthiness of the information. It is established that information from anonymous sources may not be deemed sufficiently reliable to establish probable cause for arrest, as seen in the Florida v. J.L. and United States v. Roberson cases. However, considering the de novo review standard for probable cause determinations, the court would carefully evaluate the credibility and reliability of the informant's information before making a ruling."
"misconduct has occurred.

Young, 853 P.2d 327, 348-49 (Utah 1998) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, I would conclude that the",Can mentioning irrelevant conduct by the defendant during the trial be considered prosecutorial misconduct in Utah?,"The question revolves around the issue of prosecutorial misconduct involving mentioning irrelevant conduct during the trial. In Utah, prosecutorial misconduct occurs when the prosecutor's comments direct the jurors' attention to matters that are not proper for consideration and have a reasonable likelihood of prejudicing the jury's verdict. The case of State v. Wengreen established this definition. Furthermore, Utah has explicitly rejected tactics where prosecutors reference conduct by the defendant that is not related to the charges at hand. This was evident in the cases of State v. Saunders and State v. Young, where such conduct was deemed as exceeding appropriate prosecutorial zeal and corrupting the integrity of the trial. Based on this legal reasoning, it can be concluded that mentioning irrelevant conduct by the defendant during the trial can indeed be considered prosecutorial misconduct in Utah.","Yes, mentioning irrelevant conduct by the defendant during the trial can be deemed as prosecutorial misconduct in Utah, as established in the cases of State v. Wengreen, State v. Saunders, and State v. Young."
"406 (1994). “To satisfy the prejudice inquiry, the evidence suppressed must have been material to guilt or punishment.” Gibson, 951 A.2d at 1126-1127 (Pa.2008).

In Gibson, the court emphasized that suppressed evidence must be material to guilt or punishment. Materiality extends beyond purely exculpatory evidence and includes evidence that impacts the credibility of witnesses. This principle was established in Giglio v. United States, where nondisclosure of evidence affecting credibility was considered within the general rule. Additionally, under Commonwealth v. Green, the protection of Brady extends to the defendant's ability to investigate alternative defense theories and formulate trial strategy. Therefore, evidence that affects witness credibility is considered favorable and material under Brady.","Yes, the suppression of evidence that affects the credibility of witnesses can be considered a violation of the defendant's rights under Brady, as established in Gibson, Giglio v.

"explicitly stated: “Physicians providing medical services within this hospital are not employees of University Hospital. Each physician is an independent contractor.”). ' To the contrary, where patients were given no indication that the emergency-room physicians were independent contractors, courts have held that the question of apparent authority was at least a question for the jury—the trier of fact.

This was established in cases such as Jennison v. Providence St. Vincent Med. Ctr. and Abdul-Majeed v. Emory Univ. Hosp., where it was deemed reasonable for patients to assume that the physicians were employees of the hospital due to a lack of information suggesting otherwise. Given that in the present case, Hospital HKH took no action to indicate that the emergency-room physicians were independent contractors, the issue of apparent authority could potentially be assessed by the jury.","Yes, if patients were not informed that emergency-room physicians were independent contractors and there were no indications to suggest otherwise, the issue of apparent authority could be considered a question for the jury, as established in cases like Jennison v.

"CONSTITUTIONAL PRIOR RESTRAINT ON EXPRESSION? The Supreme Court in Freedman outlined three procedural safeguards that a prior restraint on protected expression must contain to obviate the dangers of censorship: (1) the burden of going to court to suppress the speech, and the burden of proof once in court, must rest with the government; (2) any restraint prior to a judicial determination may only be for a specified brief time period in order to preserve the status quo; and (3) an avenue for prompt judicial review of the censor’s decision must be available. Freedman, 380 U.S. at 58-59, 85 S.Ct. at 739. At least some of the Freedman requirements apply to content-neutral regulations such as section 2.51. See FW/PBS, 493 U.S. at 226-29, 110 S.Ct. at 605-06 (O’Connor, J., plurality opinion) (<HOLDING>); see also id. at 238-39, 110 S.Ct. at 611",What procedural safeguards must a prior restraint on protected expression contain in order to avoid the dangers of censorship?,"The question pertains to the constitutional prior restraint on expression and the procedural safeguards it must incorporate. According to the Supreme Court's decision in Freedman, a prior restraint on protected expression must have three specific procedural safeguards in place. Firstly, the burden of going to court to suppress the speech, as well as the burden of proof, must lie with the government. Secondly, any restraint that is imposed prior to a judicial determination can only be for a limited and specified time period, ensuring that the status quo is preserved during this brief period. Lastly, there must be an avenue available for prompt judicial review of the censor's decision. These safeguards are aimed at preventing censorship and provide a framework for balancing the need for regulation with the protection of free expression. The FW/PBS case further confirms that at least some of the Freedman requirements also apply to content-neutral regulations like section 2.51.","A prior restraint on protected expression must include three procedural safeguards to avoid the dangers of censorship: (1) the burden of going to court to suppress the speech and the burden of proof must rest with the government, (2) any restraint prior to a judicial determination must be for a specified brief time period to maintain the status quo, and (3) prompt judicial review of the censor's decision must be available. These safeguards help strike a balance between regulation and protecting the right to free expression, as established in the Supreme Court case of Freedman and supported by FW/PBS."
"(noting the general rule that a final judgment from a lower court carries res judicata effect even though it is still subject to review by an appellate court). As to the other district court orders that Mr. Leo purports to appeal, he does little more than reprise the unfounded theme that Garmin’s lawyer is a fraud artist who fabricated evidence (an argument we rejected in Leo, 431 Fed.Appx. at 705) and question the impartiality and abilities of the district court judge who ruled against him. Ad hominem attacks on counsel and the district court do not count as legal argument, and Mr. Leo’s scant references to any legal issues fall short of his obligation to adequately frame and develop his arguments.

Therefore, reiterating this unfounded claim does not constitute a valid legal argument. Additionally, Mr. Leo's questioning of the impartiality and abilities of the district court judge without proper legal grounds also fails to meet the requirement of adequately framing and developing arguments. As stated in Exum v. United States Olympic Comm., 389 F.3d 1130, 1133-34 n. 4, ad hominem attacks on counsel and the district court do not fulfill the obligation of presenting legal arguments.

Additionally, the summary judgment evidence indicates that the prison guards intentionally disregarded the established treatment plan for Stewart. The court's decision in Chapman v. Johnson further supports this reasoning by stating that a defendant cannot be granted summary judgment based on qualified immunity if they knew about a prisoner's injury and treatment protocol but failed to follow it. Therefore, based on these legal standards and the evidence presented, it can be concluded that the prison guards intentionally denied or delayed access to medical care for Stewart.","Yes, the prison guards intentionally denied or delayed access to medical care for Stewart, as indicated by the precedent set in Williams v.

In Frisby, the Supreme Court established a special protection for the home, which implies a heightened concern for the individual's well-being in their personal space. However, the key factor in determining Leykis's liability lies in whether his words were intended to merely harass Carpenter. If Leykis's intention was to genuinely encourage listeners to express objections to the show's cancellation, his speech would not fall under the category of ""merely harass"" and would not be actionable for IIED. The Gormley v. Dir., Conn. State Dep't of Prob. and United States v.

Savage is responsible for the long delay, and","Is it possible for 1737 Corp to mount a defense against the transfers made by Insignia/ESG as its property manager, considering the length of time that has passed and the lack of documentary and testimonial evidence available?","The question revolves around the ability of 1737 Corp to provide a defense against the transfers made by Insignia/ESG as its property manager, given the passage of time and the unavailability of sufficient documentary and testimonial evidence. The court in City of Yonkers concluded that allowing an extension of the service period after more than four years would impose an unfair burden on the defendants to defend a lawsuit based on actions taken over seven years ago. This suggests that a significant delay in mounting a defense can be detrimental to the case. Furthermore, in Rice v. Univ. of N.D. Sch. of Med. & Health Scis., it was held that a long delay can be attributed to one party, potentially impacting the availability and reliability of evidence. Considering these factors, it may be challenging for 1737 Corp to effectively defend against the transfers without sufficient evidence, as mentioned by its counsel.","It may be difficult for 1737 Corp to mount a defense against the transfers made by Insignia/ESG as its property manager, given the passage of time and the lack of available documentary and testimonial evidence. The court's decision in City of Yonkers emphasizes the potential burden imposed by defending a lawsuit based on actions taken several years ago. Additionally, the delay in mounting a defense can impact the availability and reliability of evidence, as highlighted in the Rice v. Univ. of N.D. Sch. of Med. & Health Scis. case. Therefore, the ability of 1737 Corp to effectively defend against the transfers may be significantly hindered."
"services. Dr. Ostrer, on the other hand, maintains that he could have proceeded with his BRCA-related clinical activities without taking a license from Myriad. This assertion is based on his belief that the patents Myriad claims cover such activities are invalid because genes are patent-ineligible products of nature. Acting on his belief, Ostrer seeks in this lawsuit a declaration of his right to undertake NfiCA-related clinical activities without a license. Accordingly, Myriad and Dr. Ostrer have taken adverse legal positions regarding whether or not Ostrer can engage in BRCA genetic testing without infringing any valid claim to “isolated” BRCA DNAs or methods of “analyzing” or “comparing” BRCA sequences, as recited in Myriad’s patents.

On the other hand, Dr. Ostrer argues that the patents claimed by Myriad are invalid because genes are natural products and, therefore, not eligible for patenting. In order to assert his right to conduct BRCA-related clinical activities without a license, Dr. Ostrer has initiated this lawsuit seeking a declaration in his favor. The final decision in this case will determine whether Dr. Ostrer can perform BRCA genetic testing without infringing any valid claims in Myriad's patents.",The question of whether Dr. Ostrer can engage in BRCA genetic testing without infringing any valid claims in Myriad's patents is currently under dispute.

Such deprivation of time and relationship can never be regained, warranting some form of redress.

"L.Ed.2d 91 (1976), prohibits the state’s use of the accused’s invocation of his Fifth Amendment rights. The State asked a police detective about a statement Kemp made after his arrest. On cross-examination, Kemp’s counsel asked the police detective about other aspects of Kemp’s statement. During the redirect examination of the police detective, the prosecutor asked Detective Salgado: Q: At some point, sir, in that same conversation with Mr. Kemp, did you.actually come out and ask him questions about the apartment complex parking lot and how Hector Juarez may have gotten in the vehicle with Mr. Kemp.

The case of Griffin v. California established that it is unconstitutional for the state to use the accused's refusal to answer specific questions as evidence against them. The court held that the use of such refusal violates the accused's right against self-incrimination. In this case, when Detective Salgado asked Mr. Kemp about his reluctance to answer questions regarding the parking lot, it could potentially be seen as using Kemp's refusal as evidence against him. Therefore, if Kemp objects to the use of this evidence and files a motion for a mistrial, it would be in line with the holding of Griffin v.

In these circumstances, and particularly where the party seeking to avoid claim preclusion was the plaintiff in the prior action and the sole source of the error in naming the incorrect party, res judicata should bar the plaintiff from gaining a second opportunity to litigate the very same claims, even where complete identity between the parties is lacking.

In such cases, even if there is not a complete identity between the parties involved, res judicata should still be applied to prevent the plaintiff from relitigating the same claims. This approach prioritizes the substance of the matter over the form and aligns with the underlying goals of res judicata. The flexibility of the doctrine of privity in the res judicata context supports this interpretation.

The trial court followed",Can the appreciation of Husband's retirement accounts during the period of the parties' marriage be considered in the division of assets?,"The question pertains to the valuation and division of retirement assets in a divorce case. The controlling case in Utah, Woodward, establishes that the value of retirement assets should be determined based on the principle of equal value for all years of a defined benefit plan. The case does not make a distinction based on when the appreciation of the accounts occurred. Therefore, regardless of whether the overwhelming growth of Husband's retirement accounts took place during the marriage or later years, Woodward dictates that all years of the plan be treated as having equal value. Consequently, the appreciation of Husband's retirement accounts during the period of the parties' marriage should not be considered separately for the division of assets.","No, the appreciation of Husband's retirement accounts during the period of the parties' marriage should not be separately considered for the division of assets, as established in the Woodward case, which treats all years of a defined benefit plan as having equal value."

Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence introduced at trial was sufficient to convict Connelly of the false statement charge. A rational jury could have concluded that (a) E.J.R.C. was truthful when she testified that Connelly threatened her with jail if she did not perform oral.sex; (b) Connelly, an experienced police officer and former tribal prosecutor, fully understood the FBI agents’ questions; and (c) Connelly was not credible because his statements to Agent Kimball and Agent Smiedala about whether he threatened E.J.R.C. with jail were inconsistent.

Moreover, we find no inconsistency between","Based on the evidence presented at trial, can Connelly be convicted of the false statement charge?","The sufficiency of evidence to convict Connelly of the false statement charge is being evaluated in this case. Applying the standard set in Jackson v. Virginia, the evidence needs to be viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution. It is reasonable to conclude that E.J.R.C.'s testimony was truthful regarding Connelly's threat of jail if she did not perform oral sex. Connelly, being an experienced police officer and former tribal prosecutor, clearly understood the questions posed by the FBI agents. Inconsistencies in Connelly's statements to Agent Kimball and Agent Smiedala regarding whether he threatened E.J.R.C. with jail were also noted, which diminishes his credibility.

"to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment, and the Commissioner of Social Security may ... certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits. 42 U.S.C. § 406(b)(1)(A). Although we have never addressed the precise issue of whether § 406(b)(1)(A) authorizes an award of attorney’s fees where the district court’s judgment remanding the case to the Commissioner does not explicitly mention attorney’s fees, we have noted that the congressional intent behind § 406(b) is, in part, “to encourage effective legal representation of claimants by insuring lawyers that they will receive reasonable fees directly through certification by the Secretary.” Dawson v. Finch, 425 F.2d 1192, 1195 (5th Cir.1970) (<HOLDING>). We have also noted that one of § 406(b)’s",Can attorney's fees be awarded under 42 U.S.C. § 406(b)(1)(A) even if the district court's judgment remanding the case to the Commissioner does not explicitly mention attorney's fees?,"This question involves the interpretation of 42 U.S.C. § 406(b)(1)(A) regarding the award of attorney's fees. Although there is no specific case addressing this precise issue, the court in Dawson v. Finch recognized that § 406(b) was enacted to encourage effective legal representation of claimants by ensuring reasonable fees for attorneys. Therefore, it can be inferred that the intent behind § 406(b)(1)(A) is to allow for the award of attorney's fees even if the district court's judgment does not explicitly mention them. The language of the statute itself provides for the certification of attorney's fees out of the claimant's past-due benefits, indicating that attorney's fees can be awarded in any case where the claimant is entitled to such benefits. Therefore, even if the district court's judgment does not mention attorney's fees, an attorney may still be eligible for an award under § 406(b)(1)(A).","Yes, attorney's fees can be awarded under 42 U.S.C. § 406(b)(1)(A) even if the district court's judgment remanding the case to the Commissioner does not explicitly mention attorney's fees.

In the case of Gomez, the introduction of evidence regarding his prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon helped the government establish Gomez's awareness of the dangers and laws relating to concealed weapons. This evidence served to rebut Gomez's claim that the firearm in his car was for an innocent purpose and that its presence was mere accident or coincidence. The district court's decision to allow such evidence was within its discretion and not an abuse of that discretion. The case of United States v. Coleman also supports this reasoning as it involved the defendant putting his knowledge of the shotgun and narcotics found in the apartment at issue during trial. Similarly, the case United States v.

"indicated that the offense was sexually motivated and that the person who committed the offense did so for sexual gratification. Simmons argues that the trial court erred in admitting Neer’s testimony into evidence because, he says, the evidence was based on scientific analysis and did not meet the Frye standard. Initially, we find it imperative to note that the evidence offered through Neer’s testimony was not “profile” testimony. “Profile” evidence attempts to link the general characteristics of serial murderers to specific characteristics of the defendant. Such evidence is of little probative value and extremely prejudicial to the defendant since he is, in a sense, being accused by a witness who was not present at any of the crimes. See Pennell v. State, 602 A.2d 48, 55 (Del.1991) (<HOLDING>). Neer’s testimony did not accuse Simmons of",Did the trial court err in admitting Neer's testimony as evidence in the case?,"The question revolves around the admissibility of Neer's testimony in court, specifically whether it met the Frye standard. It is important to note that Neer's testimony was not ""profile"" evidence, which attempts to link general characteristics of serial murderers to specific characteristics of the defendant. Such evidence is generally considered to have little probative value and can be highly prejudicial to the defendant. In this case, Neer's testimony did not accuse Simmons of being a serial murderer based on general characteristics. Therefore, the objection that the evidence did not meet the Frye standard is not applicable, and the trial court did not err in admitting Neer's testimony as evidence.","No, the trial court did not err in admitting Neer's testimony as evidence in the case as it was not ""profile"" evidence and did not require meeting the Frye standard."

"Fee Statements covering May of 2010 contain two expense charges: $14.25 in FedEx delivery services and $2.44 in total postage costs. [Adv. Doc. No. 87-3, p. 16]. The Court concludes that both of these expenses—totaling $16.69— are reasonable and, therefore, recoverable as a portion of McKool Smith’s sanction award. In sum, the Court concludes that McKool Smith is entitled to $73,522.85 in fees and $655.15 in expenses, for a total amount of $74,178.00. This award represents both the amount of fees and expenses this Court determines were reasonably expended by McKool Smith in prosecuting the Original Motion for Sanctions, in addition to the amount this Court believes is appropriate to deter repetition of the Plaintiffs’ bad faith conduct.

Common sense indicates that it is, but, at this stage of the case, we need not decide that issue. Rather, we only determine that Collins is entitled to go forward with her case. Collins v. DaimlerChrysler Corp., 894 So.2d 988, 989-90 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.2004) (<HOLDING>).

"the ordinary course of the business of the partnership.” N.Y.Ptnrship L. § 24. The liability of any partner is limited to wrongful acts occurring “while the defendant was a partner”, Halperin v. Edwards and Hanly, 430 F.Supp. 121, 125 (E.D.N.Y.1977). Thus, before a defendant may be found liable for the acts of his partners it must be found: (1) that the partner committed the acts at issue in the ordinary course of the business of the partnership and (2) that the defendant was a partner at the time the acts were committed. Because the nature of their liability is joint and several, it has been held that a partner is not an indispensible party in an action naming other partners or the partnership as parties defendant. See Cone Mills Corp. v. Hurdle, 369 F.Supp. 426, 438 (N.D.Miss.1974) (<HOLDING>). Instead, it has been held that a plaintiff","If a partner commits an act in the ordinary course of the partnership's business, can the other partner be held liable for that act?","To determine the liability of a partner for the acts committed by another partner, two conditions must be met. First, it must be established that the act was committed by the partner in the ordinary course of the partnership's business. Second, it must be proven that the defendant was a partner at the time the act was committed. In the case of Halperin v. Edwards and Hanly, it was held that the liability of a partner is limited to wrongful acts occurring while the defendant was a partner. This means that if the act in question was not carried out in the ordinary course of the partnership's business or if the defendant was not a partner at the time, they cannot be held liable. Additionally, because the liability of partners is joint and several, it has been determined that a partner is not an indispensable party in a legal action naming other partners or the partnership as defendants, as established in the Cone Mills Corp. v.

"forth a prima facie case of gender discrimination. IV. Conclusion For the reasons set forth above, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court. 1 . Seibert’s PDA claim fares no better. Seibert alleged that she requested, but was denied, accommodation in the form of a reclining chair. Because this allegation was not asserted in Seibert’s EEOC charge, she has failed to preserve her claim and it must therefore be dismissed. See 29 U.S.C.A. § 626(d). Seibert raised new claims in her response to Lutron’s Motion for Summary Judgment that she was ""singled out and forced to use her vacation time simply because she was having post natal problems with her twins.” Even if these claims were timely raised, they lack merit.

"we conclude that the NTEU standard is inapplicable on these facts. 4 . Implicit in the Pickering test is a requirement that the public employer have taken some adverse employment action against the employee. See Koch v. City of Hutchinson, 847 F.2d 1436, 1440 (10th Cir.1988) (noting that Pickering and its progeny ""establish the basic framework for analyzing a claim by a public employee that his or her governmental employer made an adverse employment decision in violation of the employee’s First Amendment rights” (emphasis added)). If the action taken by the employer in response to the employee's speech is inconsequential or has only speculative consequences, there can be no basis for a First Amendment claim.

It is implicit in the Pickering test that the public employer must have taken some adverse employment action against the employee. Koch v. City of Hutchinson clarified that adverse employment decisions are essential to the analysis. Therefore, if the action taken by the employer, such as issuing a written reprimand, is inconsequential or lacks significant consequences, there is no basis for a First Amendment claim. This position is supported by the Thomsen v.

These cases reflect the recognition by the New Jersey judicial system of protecting individuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. Moreover, New Jersey has been one of the first states to acknowledge the right of an individual to adopt the biological child of their same-sex partner.

"essentially meaningless. The statute’s purpose of protecting employees whose benefits are threatened by their pension plan’s financial instability is best farthered by placing the functions most vital to participants’ well-being, interpreting the plan and determining benefits, with a fiduciary that is bound to act in their best interests. Taken together, the provisions of Title IV establish that, when PBGC is appointed a plan’s trustee following a decree of termination, it is subject to a fiduciary duty in all actions except those involving the function, statutorily reserved to the agency, of calculating the amount of benefits that are guaranteed under § 1322.

The court in Burstein v. Ret Account Plan for Employees of Allegheny Health Ed. and Res.

By placing functions such as interpreting the plan and determining benefits in the hands of a fiduciary, who is legally bound to act in the best interests of the participants, the statute's objective of safeguarding the employees is better served. While the PBGC has the authority to calculate guaranteed benefits, all other actions taken by it as a trustee are subject to fiduciary duty. Therefore, appointing a fiduciary ensures that the decisions and actions taken regarding the pension plan are made with the participants' well-being as the top priority.","It is important to appoint a fiduciary as the trustee when the PBGC takes over a pension plan to protect the employees whose benefits are threatened by the plan's financial instability.

"justified on balance, we emphasize that their appraisal of Bar-tell’s mental disabilities was an insufficient predicate for abrogating her parental rights. Specifically, both the district court and Defendants place significant credence on Dr. Van Goethem’s evaluation of Bar-tell’s “limited” intelligence level, see Bartell, 12 F.Supp.2d at 648, which is purportedly manifested by her low verbal IQ test score. While critical thinking and reasoning skills are undoubtedly relevant, at some level, to the ability of a parent to raise her child, the State must make a specific and tangible showing, not a presumptive one, on the precise nature of the links between these capacities and a particular child’s needs. See, e.g., Dunn v. Blumstein, 405 U.S. 330, 343, 92 S.Ct. 995, 31 L.Ed.2d 274 (1972) (<HOLDING>).

While the evaluation highlighted Bar-tell's ""limited"" intelligence level, as indicated by her low verbal IQ test score, it is important to note that critical thinking and reasoning skills are only one aspect of parenting ability. The State must provide a specific and tangible showing, rather than presumptions, that clearly establish the direct connection between these capacities and the specific needs of the child. The Dunn v. Blumstein case sets the precedent that such a showing is required. Therefore, solely relying on Dr. Van Goethem's evaluation of Bar-tell's intelligence level is inadequate to justify the abrogation of her parental rights.","No, the district court and Defendants cannot rely solely on Dr. Van Goethem's evaluation of Bar-tell's intelligence level to abrogate her parental rights.

Thus, under Texas law, Whitting-ton’s intent is likely presumed as a matter of law. 13 . Some courts, noting that it could be difficult to ""prove a negative” — that is, to prove reliance on facts that were not disclosed— have focused their inquiry on whether the concealed information was material, that is, whether it would have affected decision-making had it been disclosed, a standard plainly met here. See Titan Grp. v. Faggen, 513 F.2d 234, 239 (2d Cir.1975) (<HOLDING>); see also Apte v.

This requirement is consistent with the preference of relying on statutes of limitations to address issues of delay, as highlighted in Marion.

In this case, neither the district court nor the Kramer states that the plaintiff intentionally relinquished her Fourth Amendment claim. Additionally, there is no hard, judicially recognized bright line for waiver in this specific context, such as the principle that a party waives any argument not presented to the district court on appeal.

Although the pacemaker in question was implanted in 1981 and its defect was discovered in 1984, the court determined that the ""injury-causing malfunction"" did not occur until 1990. Therefore, the plaintiff was allowed to file a lawsuit because the injury occurred within a reasonable timeframe. Similarly, in Pfizer, Inc. v. Farsian, the court held that a plaintiff's fear of a potential future injury is not sufficient to support a claim under Alabama law. Based on these precedents, if the injury-causing malfunction occurred years after the product was implanted, the plaintiff may still be able to file a lawsuit if it can be proven that the injury occurred within a reasonable timeframe.","Yes, a plaintiff can file a lawsuit for a defective product even if the injury-causing malfunction occurred several years after the product was implanted, as long as the injury occurred within a reasonable timeframe, based on the precedents set in Smith v.

"it is not probative enough to meet Todd’s burden of production that Montoya acted with deliberate indifference.

Even if the evidence is not technically with rule 407’s scope: (i) rule 407’s underlying concerns are persuasive when evaluating the probative value of the evidence; and (ii) the circumstances of Montoya’s resignation in light of the other evidence in the record make the inference of wrongdoing one can draw from his resignation a weak one. See Gray v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., 82 Fed.Appx. 639, 646-47 (10th Cir.2003) (unpublished)(<HOLDING>). It is the proverbial scintilla of evidence",Can Todd rely on Montoya's resignation as evidence of wrongdoing?,"The question pertains to whether Todd can consider Montoya's resignation as evidence of wrongdoing. In the case of In re Air Crash Disaster, the court explained that the act of rewiring the CAWS by Northwest can be seen as weak and suspicious circumstantial evidence that suggests the CAWS was not foolproof at the time of the accident. Although this evidence may not fall within the strict scope of Rule 407, the concerns underlying the rule can still be relevant when evaluating the probative value of the evidence. Moreover, the circumstances surrounding Montoya's resignation, when considered alongside other evidence in the record, make the inference of wrongdoing from his resignation weak. Gray v. Hoffman-La Roche, Inc., further supports this reasoning. Therefore, Todd cannot solely rely on Montoya's resignation as strong evidence of wrongdoing.","No, Todd cannot solely rely on Montoya's resignation as strong evidence of wrongdoing, as the circumstances of his resignation, along with other evidence in the record, make the inference of wrongdoing weak, as established in the In re Air Crash Disaster and Gray v.

"the traditional purposes for similar fact evidence. Id. In this case, the prior kidnapping was clearly not similar fact evidence. Therefore, the focus of the inquiry is on whether it is relevant to the issue of premeditation; that is, whether the prior kidnapping is evidence that the murder in this case was not a heat-of-passion crime. And even if this evidence is probative, an important question still must be asked: whether the prejudicial effect of admitting the prior crime substantially outweighs its probative value. Although McWatters does not support the view that the prior kidnapping was relevant, I recognize that the prior kidnapping may be relevant under the case law relied upon by the trial court below in allowing the evidence. See Spencer v. State, 645 So.2d 377 (Fla.1994) (<HOLDING>); King v.

The traditional purposes for similar fact evidence do not apply in this case, so the relevance of the prior kidnapping needs to be assessed. The court must consider whether the prior crime is evidence indicating that the murder was not a result of a heat-of-passion situation. The case law provided suggests that the prior kidnapping may be relevant, as supported by Spencer v. State and King v. State.

The Fifth Amended Complaint challenged specifications for the first time in this case as to the 2009-10 specifications and quotas, rather than in a separate action as NRDC had done before without exception. Indeed, because NRDC did not file a separate action to challenge the 2009-10 specifications, the Fifth Amended Complaint challenged those specifications for the first time ever, in this case or any other. The magistrate judge therefore had not engaged — much less substantially engaged — the 2009-10 specifications in any prior proceeding in this case. At the time WCSPA moved to intervene, this case was not “at issue;” NMFS had not even filed a responsive pleading to the Fifth Amended Complaint. See LULAC, 131 F.3d at 1303 (<HOLDING>).

"$25, and a single gentleman, and they can only attend on Friday night, is $100 charge. (Board Hr’g Tr. at 17.)

"of the doubt or should have questioned the prosecutor’s credibility. We conclude that this determination was an unreasonable determination of the facts because the prosecutor failed to offer any credible justification for striking Jurors 016 and 019. First, we note that the prosecutor consistently identified Jurors 016 and 019 as “both young.” However, the record re veals that Juror 019 was at least a middle-aged grandmother. Indeed, Juror 019 informed the court that she was a retired nurse with seven grown children, the youngest of which had five children of her own. A prosecutor supplied with this information could not credibly identify Juror 019 as young. This incorrect factual statement supports Collins’ argument that the prosecutor was not credible.

"at 475, 226 A.2d 186. To the contrary, the Kern court noted, the Legislature in enacting the Survivor’s Act broadly intended to afford “executors or administrators an action for any trespass done to the person or property of their testator or intestate.” Id. at 472, 226 A.2d 186. Further, the court observed, prior reported cases involving survival actions appeared to recognize, without expressly so holding, that punitive damages were in fact a permissible form of recovery under the Survivor’s Act.

Thus, in Kern, supra, the plaintiffs claims",Can punitive damages be recovered under the Survivor's Act in New Jersey?,"The question at hand pertains to the availability of punitive damages under the Survivor's Act in New Jersey. In the case of Kern v. Kumar, the court highlighted that the Legislature intended to give executors or administrators the ability to bring an action for any trespass committed against the testator or intestate. Although the issue of punitive damages was not expressly addressed, prior cases involving survival actions have implicitly recognized punitive damages as a permissible form of recovery under the Survivor's Act. Notably, cases such as Meehan v. Hopps and Messina v. Petroli upheld punitive damages for reckless and wanton conduct resulting in conscious pain and suffering of the deceased. Therefore, based on the precedent set by Kern and other relevant cases, it can be reasonably concluded that punitive damages can indeed be recovered under the Survivor's Act in New Jersey.","Yes, punitive damages can be recovered under the Survivor's Act in New Jersey, as established by the court's reasoning in Kern v.

"The evidence at trial established that Defendant: (1) was informed of the delivery to his property and suggested that it be done at night, (2) was also informed when the truck arrived, and (3)was informed the next day when the drivers left his lot. Defendant claims that the only evidence of affirmative conduct on this occasion was his suggestion that the unloading take place at night. This evidence, stand ing alone, Defendant argues, is insufficient to support his aiding and abetting conviction. Defendant also argues that his previous act of giving the key to his property cannot be considered as evidence here because such only aided a general scheme of possession of marijuana, not the specific offense on October 4, 1998.

In United States v. Lombardi, it was established that previous acts of the defendant, such as giving the key to his property to aid in a general scheme of possession of marijuana, cannot be considered as evidence in a specific offense unless there is a direct connection. However, in this case, the evidence presented at trial goes beyond the defendant's mere suggestion to unload the illegal substance at night. The evidence shows that the defendant was informed of the delivery, suggested the nighttime unloading, and was also informed of the arrival and departure of the drivers. These actions, when considered collectively, demonstrate affirmative conduct that goes beyond a mere suggestion. Therefore, the defendant's argument that his suggestion alone is insufficient to support his aiding and abetting conviction is not valid.","No, the defendant cannot argue that his conviction for aiding and abetting is unsupported solely based on his suggestion to unload the illegal substance at night. The evidence presented at trial, which includes the defendant being informed of the delivery, suggesting the nighttime unloading, and knowing the arrival and departure of the drivers, demonstrates affirmative conduct that goes beyond a mere suggestion. This evidence is sufficient to support the defendant's aiding and abetting conviction."

"defendant’s jury waiver was discussed in open court as required. Most significantly, the transcript of proceedings reveals that there was no discussion of defendant’s waiver of his right to a jury.

Contrary to the State’s assertions, these two instances are insufficient to constitute a discussion of defendant’s waiver of his right to a jury trial in open court. Furthermore, although defendant signed a jury waiver, the existence of a written jury waiver is not dispositive of the issue of whether that waiver is valid.

The provision states that the court may not depart below the applicable guideline range if the facts and circumstances of the defendant's offense indicate a need to protect the public because of the involvement of actual violence or a serious threat of violence. This is further supported by the United States v. Thames case which established that the guidelines explicitly prohibit departure in cases where the offense involved actual violence.

The McCaslin court noted that “[a] juror’s disavowal of influence derived from misconduct is not a proper inquiry.” Id. at 920. Instead, the court explained, the presence or absence of injury “must be drawn from overt acts such as conversations and physical actions, i.e., what was said and done.” Id.

The court emphasized that a juror's denial of influence derived from misconduct is not a relevant inquiry. Instead, the presence or absence of injury should be determined based on overt acts, including conversations and physical actions.

The Warrant was apparently based on the detective’s observation of the substance in the jacket Moore had been seen wearing. Some time after Moore’s arrest, the substance found in Moore’s jacket tested negative for a controlled dangerous substance. A New Jersey Grand Jury voted no-bill against Moore for conspiracy, burglary, theft, and receiving stolen property. With regard to the second Warrant, Moore was found not guilty on a down-graded charge for failure to make lawful disposition of a controlled substance.

Additionally, a New Jersey Grand Jury voted no-bill against Moore for multiple charges. However, Moore was found not guilty on a downgraded charge for failure to properly dispose of a controlled substance. Based on these facts, it can be inferred that there was insufficient evidence to support the charges initially brought against Moore, resulting in a lack of probable cause.

"pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291 and we affirm. 1. The district court did not err in dismissing Smillie’s third amended complaint, replacing John Does with named individual Defendants, as barred by the statute of limitations. There is no evidence in the record satisfying the requirements of relation back. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c); Miguel v. Country Funding Corp., 309 F.3d 1161, 1165 (9th Cir.2002) (as amended). Smillie did not advance any relation back argument before the district court, and conceded as much at oral argument. By assuming relation back was automatic, Smillie offered no proof to trigger the provision and failed to show that Defendants were provided notice of the complaint and were not prejudiced by the amendment. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c)(1)(C); Miguel, 309 F.3d at 1165 (<HOLDING>).

According to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), relation back is required for such substitution. However, in this case, there is no evidence in the record demonstrating that the requirements for relation back have been met. The court in Miguel v. Country Funding Corp. emphasized that relation back is not automatic; it necessitates proof and notice to the defendants without prejudicing them. Since Smillie did not present any relation back argument before the district court and conceded this during oral argument, the provision has not been triggered. Consequently, the district court did not err in dismissing Smillie's complaint.","No, Smillie cannot replace John Does with named individual Defendants in the complaint after the statute of limitations has expired because the requirements for relation back have not been satisfied, as affirmed in Miguel v.

"if any of them believed that the Creditor Group was legally barred from ... bringing the Claims, (Answering Br. at 21.) We agree. To hold otherwise would allow a “claw back” of the sale itself because the value of the claims, without the ability to prosecute them, would be completely eliminated and a central feature of the transaction would thus be frustrated, through no apparent fault of the Creditor Group.

The Ninth Circuit has interpreted the similar Federal Rule of Civil Procedure and held that the requirement of personal knowledge and competence to testify can be inferred from the affidavits themselves.

The Board, citing the Court's affirmance of Cooner's disbarment, argues against allowing a motion to challenge the judgment.

The Supreme Court has clarified that even in federal habeas cases, deference does not mean giving up on judicial review. A federal court can disagree with a state court's determination and, when guided by AEDPA (Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act), conclude that the state court's decision was unreasonable or based on incorrect factual premises. This means that the federal court can provide relief when the state court decision fails to meet the standard of reasonableness or when there is clear and convincing evidence of factual inaccuracies.","Deference in the context of federal habeas and reviewing state court decisions does not imply a complete abandonment of judicial review.

In order to determine this, the court looks at the definition of ""products or services"" as outlined in case law. In Atlanticare Med. Ctr. v. Cmty. Health All., the court established that the phrase ""products or services,"" when used in the NJCFA, should be interpreted under the doctrine of ejusdem generis. This means that it should be understood as a comprehensive definition encompassing similar products or services to those specifically mentioned. In scenarios such as Monarch Enters., Inc. v. L.H. Sales & Assocs., the court found that services incidental to a contract for the sale of products were not protected under the NJCFA. Thus, in cases like Shogen v. Global Aggressive Growth Fund, Ltd., where services provided were not something directly sold to the public but rather incidental to a product sale, they were not afforded the protection of the NJCFA. Therefore, to determine whether the services provided by the defendants are protected under the NJCFA, it would be necessary to evaluate if these services fall under the definition stated in case law.","Whether the services provided by the defendants are covered by the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act depends on whether these services are incidental to a product sale or are independently sold to the public, as established by case law. The determination of their protection under the NJCFA requires further analysis based on the specific circumstances of the case."
"mobile home because the comprehensive terms provided in N.C. Gen. Stat. § 20-72(b) had not been met might be germane to our analysis if tort law or liability insurance coverage were implicated. But see N. C. National Bank v. Robinson, 78 N.C. App. 1, 336 S.E.2d 666 (1985) (declining to apply the MVA even where the cause of action was the tort of wrongful conversion because the dispute primarily involved, “not an automobile accident case,” but, rather, security interest and entrustment issues arising out of “a business transaction in which the policies underlying the private UCC law [were] fully implicated”). The fact that the Hayes Court expressly limited its holding to these circumstances has been emphasized by our courts on several occasions.

In N.C. National Bank v. Robinson, the court declined to apply the MVA to a case of wrongful conversion since it primarily involved security interest and entrustment issues related to a business transaction, rather than an automobile accident. This decision highlighted that the MVA should not be automatically applied when the underlying issue falls outside the confines of an automobile accident. It is crucial to recognize that the Hayes Court specifically limited its holding to these circumstances, emphasizing the narrow scope of its application. Therefore, even if the comprehensive terms prescribed in N.C. Gen.

One type apparently serves as an instrument of prayer and meditation while the other serves to identify the wearer as a devotee of Krishna. ISKCON’s sale of the former is of no moment to the First Amendment; those beads may be an aid to spiritual activity, but they are not in themselves communicative. I presume that the Park Service could not prohibit the use of a rosary or perhaps of a prayer mat on the Mall, but that does not mean that it must also allow vendors to sell them there.

Therefore, based on these precedents, the phrase ""whether or not"" in a superior heading is indeed considered to modify the article descriptions in the provisions under that heading.","Yes, according to the cases of General Electric Co. v. United States and Montgomery Ward & Co., Inc. v. United States, the phrase ""whether or not"" in a superior heading is deemed to modify the article descriptions in the provisions under that heading, even if it is not explicitly restated in each provision."

William Inglis & Sons Baking Co. v. ITT Continental Baking Co., 668 F.2d 1014, 1053 (9th Cir.1981). In the Ninth Circuit, if a complaint does not include the necessary factual allegations to state a claim, it is not sufficient to allege such claims in a motion for summary judgment. Navajo Nation v.

The first amended complaint alleges a general",Can a plaintiff assert new factual allegations to support a claim in a motion for summary judgment if the original complaint does not include these allegations?,"The question involves the amendment of a complaint to include new factual allegations in a motion for summary judgment. In the Ninth Circuit, if a complaint does not contain the necessary factual allegations to state a claim, it is insufficient to assert such claims in a motion for summary judgment. This principle was established in the Navajo Nation v. U.S. Forest Serv. case, where the court held that summary judgment is not a procedural opportunity to expand upon inadequate pleadings. The court also cited Wasco Prods., Inc. v. Southwall Techs., Inc. and Pickern v. Pier 1 Imports (U.S.), Inc. to further support this reasoning. Therefore, based on Ninth Circuit precedent, a plaintiff cannot introduce new factual allegations to support a claim in a motion for summary judgment if these allegations were not included in the original complaint.","No, a plaintiff cannot assert new factual allegations in a motion for summary judgment if the original complaint does not include these allegations, as stated in the Navajo Nation v.

"there was no support in the text or history of § 1252 for such a construction. 533 U.S. at 351, 121 S.Ct. 2268. Accordingly, the Supreme Court affirmed the Second Circuit’s holdings that it lacked jurisdiction over a petition for direct review, and that § 1252 did not preclude the petitioners from pursuing habeas relief in the district court under § 2241. Id. at 349-50, 352, 121 S.Ct. 2268. Thus, we disagree with the government’s argument that Mr. Latu could have raised all the issues in his habeas corpus petition in a petition for direct review. We conclude that Mr. Latu properly filed a timely habeas petition to bring his constitutional claims that were not reviewable on direct review under § `1252(a)(2)(C). See Jurado-Gutierrez v.

The Court further held that section 1252 does not preclude petitioners from seeking habeas relief in the district court under section 2241. Consequently, it can be deduced that Mr. Latu could not have raised all his issues in a petition for direct review. This conclusion aligns with the precedent set in Jurado-Gutierrez v.

"BIA’s factfinding. The very heart of Petitioners’ claim, that the BIA’s analysis regarding their fears for their daughter’s safety was not “detailed” and failed to “adequately” address the issue, is fundamentally an objection to a factual determination by the BIA and the relative evidentiary weight the agency gave to competing considerations. In fact, the BIA directly addressed Petitioners’ fears for Tashfia’s safety and found that the IJ had “properly considered the relevant factors in the aggregate,” including consideration of Petitioners’ “testimony that they believed their daughter might be kidnapped in Bangladesh, as one of the potential hardship factors.” We have repeatedly held that “[cjloaking [a factual claim] in the garb of legal error does not alter its nature.” Id. at 73 (<HOLDING>); see also Rashad v.

While this type of association can extend to other types of relationships, depending on the size, purpose, policies, selectivity, congeniality and other characteristics of the “association” involved, plaintiff cites no case and this Court has not found one which would extend this type of association to the workplace. See, e.g., Copp v. Unified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 882 F.2d 1547, 1551 (10th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>).

"groundwater. Thus, although the PCE contamination (as Sen try now argues) was not actually known or discovered by Greenbriar until 1996 (after the expiration of the Sentry policies), it may have “manifested itself” — that is, it may have been discoverable through reasonable testing — during the effective terms of each of the Sentry policies. Even if, as Sentry urges, “manifest” could be taken also to mean “discovered,” there would be, at most, an ambiguity in the meaning of “manifest” in this case, because “discoverable,” as shown supra, is at the very least an equally plausible definition of the term. The existence of such an ambiguity requires application of well-settled rules of construction as aids in the interpretive enterprise. See, e.g., Partnership Umbrella, 530 S.E.2d at 160 (<HOLDING>); State Farm Fire & Cas. Co. v.

General Motors Corp., 305 F.3d 545, 553 (6th Cir.2002).

In analyzing this question, we must consider the scope of copyright protection and the extra-element test. Under 17 U.S.C. § 102, tangible works of authorship are protected by copyright law. The court in this case held that the Tentative Map and its supporting documents qualify as tangible works of authorship and are thus protected by copyright. The second prong of the analysis, the extra-element test, focuses on whether the extra elements alleged by the development company change the nature of their claim or simply restate a copyright claim. The court determined that the development company's argument of breach of fiduciary duty by giving the map to a competitor did not alter the nature of their claim, but rather constituted a copyright claim. Therefore, based on this analysis, the development company cannot file an unfair competition claim solely based on the misappropriation of time and effort expended in producing the Tentative Map.","No, the development company cannot file an unfair competition claim based on the misappropriation of time and effort expended in producing the Tentative Map, as it would be considered a copyright claim rather than an unfair competition claim according to the court's analysis."

"caught in the middle of acrimonious custody battles, I agree with the Court’s holding that the Texas Family Code does not afford a trial court such discretion.

I write separately to briefly explain this history and to illuminate why this subject has resulted in a lack of uniformity among the courts of appeals. I. The Common-Law Doctrine of Necessaries As the Court notes, the underpinnings of the doctrine of necessaries may be traced back over three centuries to English courts. 419 S.W.3d 292, 298-99 (citing Note, The Unnecessary Doctrine of Necessaries, 82 Mioh.

However, the Texas Family Code does not grant trial courts the discretion to award attorney's fees in modification and enforcement proceedings. This discrepancy has resulted in differing interpretations and approaches by the courts of appeals, leading to a lack of uniformity in their decisions regarding the treatment of attorney's fees in such proceedings.","The lack of uniformity among the courts of appeals regarding the treatment of attorney's fees in modification and enforcement proceedings is a result of the complicated history and evolution of the common-law doctrine of necessaries, coupled with the absence of discretionary power granted to trial courts by the Texas Family Code in this matter."

Factors such as the degree of autonomy, the source of the entity's funding, and the nature of its functions are considered. While the Eleventh Amendment shields the state treasury from liability, it does not extend protection to counties and municipal corporations.

"Mr. Brennan further testified that based on his examination of the project as compared with Morganti’s as-planned WC01 schedule and as-built progress from February 22, 1996, through termination, it was his opinion that any delays that occurred beyond WC01 were caused by Morganti and not the actions of the FBOP. As noted above, Mr. Brennan did not consider the parties’ Schedule B Agreement regarding the use of Morganti’s WC04 schedule as a baseline for measuring progress and delays, and thus his analysis disregards the parties’ stated intent. In such circumstances, the court’s role is to comb through the evidence and determine whether, based on the record, Morganti was entitled to any time beyond December 31, 1996, for critical path delays caused by Mod 192.

Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), is advocatory. In Imbler, the prosecutor was alleged to have knowingly used false testimony and suppressed material exculpatory evidence at trial. The Court upheld the lower courts’ rulings that the prosecutor was absolutely immune from potential liability for the alleged misconduct. As other courts have recognized, it follows from Imbler that the failure, be it knowing or inadvertent, to disclose material exculpatory evidence before trial also' falls within the protection afforded by absolute prosecutorial immunity. See Hill, 45 F.3d at 662 (<HOLDING>); Carter v. Burch, 34 F.3d 257, 262 (4th",Can a prosecutor be held liable for failing to disclose material exculpatory evidence before a trial?,"The question pertains to the liability of a prosecutor for failing to disclose material exculpatory evidence prior to a trial. In the case of Imbler, the Supreme Court determined that prosecutors are immune from potential liability for alleged misconduct, including cases where they knowingly used false testimony or suppressed material exculpatory evidence at trial. Other courts, such as in Hill and Carter v. Burch, have recognized that this immunity also extends to the failure, whether intentional or unintentional, to disclose material exculpatory evidence before a trial. Therefore, based on the principle of absolute prosecutorial immunity established in Imbler, a prosecutor cannot be held liable for failing to disclose material exculpatory evidence before a trial.","No, a prosecutor cannot be held liable for failing to disclose material exculpatory evidence before a trial, as they are granted absolute immunity for such actions, as established in Imbler v.

"stressed that an employer can be vicariously liable for conduct of an employee that was (1) done in furtherance of the employer’s business or at least partly motivated by an intention to serve the employer; (2) of the kind that the employee was employed to perform; (8) substantially within the authorized “time and space” limits of the employment; or (4) expectable in view of the employee’s duties. Booker v. GTE.net LLC, 350 F.3d 515, 518-19 (6th Cir.2003) (applying Kentucky law). As an initial matter, I note that RWT is not necessarily relieved of vicarious liability for malicious prosecution solely because it is an intentional tort. There are numerous decisions finding employers vicariously liable for the intentional torts of their employees. See, e.g., Patterson, 172 S.W.3d at 363 (<HOLDING>); Frederick v. Collins, 378 S.W.2d 617",Can an employer be held vicariously liable for an employee's conduct of malicious prosecution?,"The issue at hand is whether an employer can be held vicariously liable for an employee's conduct of malicious prosecution. The court in Booker v. GTE.net LLC established that an employer can be vicariously liable for the actions of an employee if the conduct was done in furtherance of the employer's business, motivated by an intention to serve the employer, of the kind that the employee was employed to perform, substantially within the authorized ""time and space"" limits of the employment, or expectable in view of the employee's duties. This means that if the employee's actions of malicious prosecution were closely related to their work or done with the intention to benefit the employer, and within the authorized limits of their employment, the employer can be held vicariously liable. Additionally, the fact that malicious prosecution is an intentional tort does not necessarily relieve the employer of vicarious liability, as there have been previous cases where employers were held liable for intentional torts committed by their employees. One such example is the Patterson case. Therefore, based on these legal principles, it is possible for an employer to be held vicariously liable for an employee's conduct of malicious prosecution.","Yes, an employer can be held vicariously liable for an employee's conduct of malicious prosecution if the employee's actions were done in furtherance of the employer's business, motivated by an intention to serve the employer, of the kind that the employee was employed to perform, substantially within the authorized ""time and space"" limits of the employment, or expectable in view of the employee's duties, as established in the Booker v.

The argument raised by the BLM is that the Supreme Court case SUWA, which deals with limitations on APA suits for agency inaction, prevents review in this matter. However, SUWA only specifically addresses suits for agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed, and does not pertain to the failure to consider wilderness characteristics. Additionally, the BLM asserts that Vermont Yankee, another Supreme Court case, also prevents addressing the failings of the EIS. However, Vermont Yankee's analysis is not directly applicable to the BLM's failure to consider wilderness characteristics. Furthermore, the BLM argues that deference should be given to their chosen methodology for NEPA compliance, including the failure to consider wilderness characteristics. However, the BLM's failure to consider wilderness characteristics raises concerns regarding the thoroughness of their NEPA obligations. Thus, none of the arguments raised by the BLM are persuasive in this case.","No, the BLM can be held accountable for its failure to consider wilderness characteristics in compliance with NEPA obligations, as neither the SUWA nor the Vermont Yankee cases prevent addressing the deficiencies in the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS), and deference to the BLM's methodology does not absolve them of their obligation to consider wilderness characteristics."

Donald have upheld the constitutionality of these statutes, citing the government's important interests in monitoring and rehabilitating supervised releasees, solving crimes, and exonerating innocent individuals. The courts have weighed these interests against the privacy concerns of the individuals involved, considering factors such as the minimal inconvenience caused by a blood draw and the limited use of genetic information for identification purposes only.

"asserted by Congress and requirements imposed by state law. Nor has it mattered whether the States have acted through laws of broad general application rather than laws specifically directed towards the governance of industrial relations. Regardless of the mode adopted, to allow the States to control conduct which is the subject of national regulation would create potential frustration of national purposes. However, it is clear that preemption under Garmon is not “complete.” Every court to address the issue directly has reached this conclusion. See Lontz v. Tharp, 413 F.3d 435, 442-43 (4th Cir.2005) (“[Sjections 7 and 8 do not work to completely preempt the kind of state law claims that plaintiffs are pressing.”); Felix v.

In Johnson v. Smith, the court held that the failure of counsel to assert such rights for a fugitive client cannot be considered as ineffective assistance of counsel. This implies that counsel's responsibility to advocate for their client's rights does not extend to individuals who are fugitives from the law. Therefore, if counsel fails to assert rights on behalf of a fugitive client, it cannot be grounds for claiming ineffective assistance of counsel. The decision in Johnson v. Caldwell also aligns with this reasoning.","No, the failure of counsel to assert rights on behalf of a fugitive client cannot be considered as ineffective assistance of counsel, as established in Johnson v.

"against each other, thereby avoiding ‘the absurdity of making A pay B when B owes A.’ ”) (quoting Studley v. Boylston Nat’l Bank, 229 U.S. 523, 528, 33 S.Ct. 806, 57 L.Ed. 1313 (1913) (emphasis added)). In this case, allowing Bechtel to set off its obligation to Shaw against Bechtel’s claim against the Debtor would result in a different absurdity — essentially, A (Bechtel) would not have to pay B (Shaw) because C (Debtor) owes A. Shaw argues that the phrase “other transactions” in the Offset Provision means other transactions with “SUBCONTRACTOR,” which is now Shaw. Shaw concedes that to the extent there are any sums due by it to Bechtel under any of the Contracts assigned by the Debtor to it, Bechtel may offset those sums against t le’s State Bank, 68 F.2d 110, 111 (4th Cir.1934) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, Bechtel asserts that the parties",Can Bechtel offset its obligation to Shaw against Bechtel's claim against the Debtor?,"The question revolves around the concept of set-off and the interpretation of the phrase ""other transactions"" in the Offset Provision. The court in Studley v. Boylston Nat'l Bank highlighted the principle of set-off, which allows for the offsetting of obligations between parties to avoid the absurdity of making one party pay the other when the other party owes the first party. In this case, allowing Bechtel to set off its obligation to Shaw against Bechtel's claim against the Debtor would result in a situation where Bechtel would not have to pay Shaw because the Debtor owes Bechtel. However, Shaw argues that the phrase ""other transactions"" in the Offset Provision refers to transactions with ""SUBCONTRACTOR,"" which is Shaw itself. Shaw concedes that if there are any sums due to Bechtel under the Contracts assigned by the Debtor to Shaw, Bechtel may offset those sums. Based on the precedent set in FPL Farmingdale, LLC v.

"contends that if we uphold the award of guardianship as a permanent plan, “then respondent’s compliance with OCDSS and court demands becomes irrelevant to whether or not reunification efforts would be futile.” Respondent-father counters that OCDSS’s argument is circular; we believe it is more properly characterized as backwards, probably because OCDSS has changed its position in this appeal from its position in the trial court. On appeal, OCDSS now supports the trial court’s decision to cease reunification efforts. At the hearing, OCDSS recommended that reunification efforts continue. In some instances, parties may be judicially estopped from taking inconsistent positions at different points in the same litigation. See In re Maynard, 116 N.C.

In this case, the OCDSS initially recommended that reunification efforts should continue but later supported the trial court's decision to cease these efforts. In certain circumstances, parties may be judicially estopped from taking inconsistent positions during the same litigation. The principle of judicial estoppel prevents a party from changing their position to suit their current circumstances or benefit their case. As seen in the In re Maynard case, the court held that inconsistent positions taken by a party during the course of the same litigation can be subject to judicial estoppel. Considering this principle, the respondent-father can argue that the OCDSS's change in position on reunification efforts is not only inconsistent but also potentially subject to judicial estoppel.","Yes, the respondent-father can argue that the OCDSS's change in position on reunification efforts may be subject to judicial estoppel, as observed in the In re Maynard case."

However, TMC failed to demonstrate such a probability for several reasons. Firstly, the Customer List was already known by employees and others involved in the business, which diminishes its secrecy and the potential for it to qualify as a trade secret. Secondly, AICE, the defendant, did not take adequate measures to protect the confidentiality of the Customer List, further undermining its claim to trade secret protection. Lastly, the ease with which the Customer List could be acquired or duplicated by others raises doubts about its status as a trade secret. Therefore, based on these factors, TMC has not shown a probability of success in proving that the Customer List is entitled to trade secret protection pending trial on the merits.","No, TMC has not established a probability of success in proving that the Customer List is entitled to trade secret protection pending trial on the merits, due to factors such as the knowledge of the list by employees and others, the lack of protective measures taken by AICE, and the ease of acquisition or duplication of the Customer List."

The issue presented by Smith is initially","Did the officers in this case follow law enforcement standards for subduing the individual, based on the expert's declaration?","The question at hand involves the officers' conduct in subduing the individual and whether it aligned with law enforcement standards.

The expert concluded that the officers had alternative techniques available to them that presented a lesser threat of death or serious injury, such as using control holds to complete the arrest instead of siccing the police dog on the individual. In determining the reasonableness of the officers' conduct, it is important to consider the legal precedent established in Tennessee v. Garner and Garcia v. United States. Tennessee v. Garner outlined that the use of deadly force is only justified when it is necessary to prevent the escape of a fleeing suspect and when the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to the officer or others. Garcia v. United States further supports the use of force when a suspect points a gun at officers as being objectively reasonable. Taking these factors into account, it is necessary to analyze whether the officers' conduct in this case adhered to law enforcement standards.","The question of whether the officers followed law enforcement standards for subduing the individual depends on an analysis of California's Peace Officer Standards and Training.

The court in the case of TKU v. WSSC established that the dedication of the property valued at $800,000 to the public did not create any vested rights for TKU. The court's reasoning was based on the absence of evidence showing that TKU had been guaranteed a permit to redevelop the property or that any valid promises had been made by appropriate officials. In order for TKU to obtain a vested zoning status, there needed to be conclusive evidence of such guarantees or promises from officials. Therefore, based on the court's rationale, TKU did not have any vested rights to redevelopment.","No, TKU did not have any vested rights to redevelopment based on the dedication of the property to the public, as established in the TKU v. WSSC case."

The Restatement defines the doctrine of promissory estoppel as follows: A promise which the promisor should reasonably expect to induce action of forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person and which does induce such action or forbearance is binding if injustice can be avoided only by enforcement of the promise. The remedy granted for breach may be limited as justice requires. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90 (1979). The doctrine of promissory estoppel is used to enforce a promise where there is a lack of consideration and as such does not apply to the facts of this ease. See Hatfield v. Columbia Federal Savings Bank, 57 Wash.App..876, 790 P.2d 1258, 1263 (1990) (<HOLDING>). In this case there is an express contract and",Can the doctrine of promissory estoppel be used to enforce a promise in this case where there is an express contract?,"The question pertains to the applicability of the doctrine of promissory estoppel in a scenario where there is already an express contract. The Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 90 defines promissory estoppel as a binding promise that induces action or forbearance on the part of the promisee or a third person. However, it is important to note that promissory estoppel is typically used to enforce promises in situations where there is a lack of consideration. In the Hatfield v. Columbia Federal Savings Bank case, the court held that the doctrine of promissory estoppel was not applicable because there was already an express contract in place. Therefore, in this case where there is an express contract, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be used to enforce a promise.","No, the doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be used to enforce a promise in this case where there is already an express contract. This has been established in the Hatfield v. Columbia Federal Savings Bank case."
"this regard, in Benavidez v. City of Albuquerque, 101 F.3d 620-627 (10th Cir.1996), we spoke as follows: When the pre-termination process offers little or no opportunity for the employee to present his side of the case, the procedures in the post-termination hearing become much more important. Such a post-termination hearing represents the only meaningful opportunity the employee has to challenge the employer’s action, and requiring a dismissed employee to prove in this context that he was terminated without just cause may increase the risk of an erroneous deprivation. It is often difficult to prove a negative, and where the pre-termination process has been minimal, the employee’s fate may depend entirely upon the post-termination hearing. Cf. Lavine, 424 U.S. at 585, 96 S.Ct. at 1016 (<HOLDING>); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 525, 78","In the event that an employee has been terminated without just cause, does the post-termination hearing provide the only meaningful opportunity for the employee to challenge the employer's action?","The issue at hand is whether the post-termination hearing provides the only significant chance for an employee to challenge the employer's action when minimal pre-termination procedures have been provided. In the case of Benavidez v. City of Albuquerque, it was stated that when the pre-termination process limits or does not allow the employee to present their side of the case, the significance of the post-termination hearing is amplified. The post-termination hearing becomes the sole meaningful opportunity for the employee to contest the justification for their termination. Requiring the employee to prove that they were terminated without just cause in this context may lead to an increased risk of an unjust deprivation. Particularly when the pre-termination process has been limited, the outcome of the employee's fate rests solely on the post-termination hearing. This is in line with the principle established in Lavine and Speiser v. Randall.","Yes, the post-termination hearing serves as the primary opportunity for an employee to challenge their termination if the pre-termination process has provided minimal or no opportunity for the employee to present their case, as discussed in Benavidez v. City of Albuquerque, Lavine, and Speiser v. Randall."
"it from either the United States, one of the fifty states, or the District of Columbia; all others are 'foreign' corporations”). The United States Supreme Court has also suggested that whether a corporation is foreign or domestic is dependent on its ""charter.” See, e.g., Can. Southern R. Co. v. Gebhard, 109 U.S. 527, 537, 3 S.Ct. 363, 27 L.Ed. 1020 (1883) (""A corporation 'must dwell in the place of its creation, and cannot migrate to another sovereignty,’ though it may do business in all places where its charter allows * * *. But wherever it goes for business it carries its charter, as that is the law of its existence * * *.""). We have expressed a similar view on nationality. See, e.g., State ex rel. Ohsman & Sons, Co. v. Starkweather, 214 Minn. 232, 237, 7 N.W.2d 747, 749 (1943) (<HOLDING>). 5 . Our conclusion is confirmed by Treas.","From a legal perspective, can a corporation be considered foreign or domestic based on its charter?","The determination of whether a corporation is foreign or domestic can often be dependent on its charter. The United States Supreme Court, in cases like Can. Southern R. Co. v. Gebhard, has suggested that a corporation's status is closely tied to its charter. The charter serves as the law of the corporation's existence and dictates where it can do business. Similarly, in the case of State ex rel. Ohsman & Sons, Co. v. Starkweather, the court expressed a similar view on corporate nationality. These authorities support the idea that a corporation's domestic or foreign status can be determined by examining its charter.","Yes, a corporation can be considered foreign or domestic based on its charter, as supported by legal authorities such as Can. Southern R. Co. v. Gebhard and State ex rel. Ohsman & Sons, Co. v. Starkweather."
"in seeking a lower sentence, the record must both reflect both that the district judge considered the defendant’s argument and that the judge explained the basis for rejecting it.” United States v. Vonner, 452 F.3d 560, 567 (6th Cir.2006); United States v. Richardson, 437 F.3d 550, 554 (6th Cir.2006). This Court will only uphold a sentence if it is reasonable. Reasonableness contains two facets: substantive and procedural. See United States v. Webb, 403 F.3d 373, 383 (6th Cir.2005); United States v. Jones, 445 F.3d 865 (6th Cir.2006) (Moore, J., dissenting on the ground that the majority opinion conflicted with prior Circuit precedent). In reviewing for reasonableness, this Court employs a presumption of substantive reasonableness. United States v. Williams, 436 F.3d 706, 708 (2006) (<HOLDING>). That is, this Court presumes that the","If a district judge rejects a defendant's argument for a lower sentence, is it necessary for the judge to explain the basis for rejecting it?","The question pertains to the requirement of a district judge to explain the basis for rejecting a defendant's argument for a lower sentence. The United States v. Vonner case and the United States v. Richardson case, both of the Sixth Circuit, establish that in order for a sentence to be upheld, the record must reflect that the district judge considered the defendant's argument and also that the judge provided an explanation for rejecting it. This requirement ensures transparency and accountability in the sentencing process. Additionally, a sentence is deemed reasonable when it satisfies both substantive and procedural facets. The United States v. Webb case and the United States v. Jones case (with a dissenting opinion from Judge Moore) further support the notion of reasonableness in sentencing. In applying a presumption of substantive reasonableness, this Court assumes that the sentence is reasonable unless proven otherwise.","Yes, it is necessary for a district judge to explain the basis for rejecting a defendant's argument for a lower sentence.

"not, we believe, a factor that ought to have been eliminated from any consideration. Conclusion Because the bankruptcy court did not take into account all of the factors that it ought to have weighed and because it did not place the ultimate burden of establishing the § 523(a)(15)(B) exception on the debtor, we must vacate the decision of the district court and remand the case to that court with instructions to remand it to the bankruptcy court for new factual findings made under the proper burden of proof. Therefore, we vacate the judgment of the district court with directions that the case be remanded to the bankruptcy court for further consideration consistent with this opinion.

In light of these errors, it is necessary to vacate the district court's judgment and remand the case back to the bankruptcy court. Here, the court must provide new factual findings while appropriately bearing the burden of proof. The ruling in Farrey v. Sanderfoot further reinforces the need for a comprehensive assessment in these circumstances.","Yes, the bankruptcy court's decision and burden of proof need to be reconsidered in light of the relevant factors that were neglected.

The robberies brought both McGuire and Earlywine to Kansas City on numerous occasions to obtain firearms through the Mandarinas and to launder money. Most importantly, the robberies explained why McGuire would entrust Earlywine with knowledge of the Strada murder and why Mandacina would discuss a contract murder with McGuire, in Early-wine’s presence, without fearing that he would be reported to the authorities immediately. In light of the above, the evidence was more probative than prejudicial. The trial court need not issue a prior crimes limiting instruction sua sponte. See United States v.

In this case, the evidence of the robberies committed by Mandacina, McGuire, and Earlywine was introduced to clarify their relationship, explain their actions, and provide context for the murder of Strada. The evidence of these prior crimes was deemed more probative than prejudicial, as it helped establish the motive and intent of the defendants. Therefore, the trial court concluded that there was no need for a prior crimes limiting instruction.","The trial court did not need to issue a prior crimes limiting instruction in this case because the evidence of the robberies committed by the defendants was deemed more probative than prejudicial and was necessary to provide context and clarify their relationship, motive, and intent, as established in United States v.

"Second, 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a) includes as enumerated offenses under the IMCA “murder, manslaughter, ... [and] felony child abuse or neglect.” 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a). Given that 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a) discusses both manslaughter, and felony child abuse or neglect, it is difficult to say that 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) qualifies as defining both manslaughter and felony child abuse or neglect. A court should strive to give both of these words in the IMCA operative effect when interpreting the statute. See United States v. Nordic Vill., Inc., 503-U.S. at 35, 112 S.Ct. 1011. Allowing involuntary manslaughter under 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) to define both manslaughter, and felony child abuse or neglect, would run contrary to this canon of construction. See United States v. Other Medicine, 596 F.3d at 680-81 (<HOLDING>). Consequently, the Court declines to adopt",Does 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) define both manslaughter and felony child abuse or neglect under 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a)?,"The question centers around the interpretation of 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a) and 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) in relation to manslaughter and felony child abuse or neglect. According to the language of 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a), offenses such as manslaughter and felony child abuse or neglect are included. However, based on the interpretative principle of giving operative effect to every word in a statute, as established in United States v. Nordic Vill., Inc., it can be argued that 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) cannot define both manslaughter and felony child abuse or neglect. Allowing involuntary manslaughter under 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) to define both offenses would contradict the canon of construction. Therefore, it can be concluded that 18 U.S.C. § 1112(a) does not define both manslaughter and felony child abuse or neglect under 18 U.S.C. § 1153(a).","No, based on the interpretation of the statutes and the canon of construction established in United States v.

"A lie does not become the truth simply because the person hearing it knows that it is a lie. The premise underlying this argument reveals the true nature of the matic because they are effectively invoking estoppel against the government. The Defendants contend that because the government’s remission of payment represents that the government entity has evaluated all the relevant information and (presumably) determined that a claim is valid, the government should be estopped from arguing that the claim is invalid in a subsequent judicial proceeding. The premise underlying this argument is contrary to our longstanding presumption that estoppel against the government is impermissible. See, e.g., Federal Crop Ins. Corp. v.

This means that the government cannot be prevented from arguing that a claim is invalid in a subsequent judicial proceeding, even if they have previously remitted payment. The Defendants' argument, that the government's remission of payment implies the validity of a claim and should estop the government from arguing otherwise, is contrary to this presumption. Therefore, based on the principle of estoppel against the government, the government cannot be estopped from asserting the invalidity of a claim in a subsequent judicial proceeding, despite the remission of payment.","No, the government cannot be estopped from arguing that a claim is invalid in a subsequent judicial proceeding, even if they have remitted payment, as established in the case of Federal Crop Ins.

The court in Kesselring v. F/T Arctic Hero held that when a party fails to raise an issue in their first appeal, it is considered waived. In this case, Schoenfeld did not contest the ERISA ruling in his initial appeal, and therefore, according to the principle of waiver established in Kesselring, his opportunity to challenge the ruling may be considered waived. It is important to note that a previous appeal only vacated and remanded for the reconsideration of the dischargeability of Schoenfeld's debt, and did not address the ERISA violations. Additionally, the satisfaction of Schoenfeld's debt does not render the injunctive relief for future violations of ERISA moot, as established in FTC v. Affordable Media.","Yes, Schoenfeld's failure to challenge the district court's ERISA ruling in his initial appeal may waive his opportunity to contest it now, given the principle of waiver established in Kesselring v.

In the post-nuptial agreement, however, Mr. Short promised to repay his loan to Ms. Short “if the marriage lastfed] more than three years.” More significantly, the decree of dissolution of June 3, 1993, provided that Mr. Short “owed to [Ms. Short] $41,450” at 8.469% interest and that Mr. Short would “pay the sum of $600 per month to [Ms. Short] until such time as the loan [was] paid.” Mr. Short’s contention that his $50,000 loan from Ms. Short is not divorce-related, even though the terms of its repayment were expressly incorporated into the decree of dissolution, lacks merit.

Despite Mr. Short's claim that the loan is not divorce-related, the terms of its repayment were expressly incorporated into the decree of dissolution. This means that the loan was recognized and established as part of the divorce settlement. In the case of In re Crosswhite, the court held that when a loan is explicitly included in the terms of a dissolution decree, it becomes a divorce-related debt. Therefore, Mr. Short's argument lacks merit as the loan has been deemed divorce-related due to its incorporation into the decree.","No, Mr. Short cannot argue that his $50,000 loan from Ms. Short is not divorce-related as it was expressly incorporated into the decree of dissolution, making it a recognized part of the divorce settlement.

"in domestic law. Although a dismissal of the family court action certainly may have an effect on whether Stone pursues the circuit court action against Thompson, the two actions are completely separate. Therefore, the family court’s order, which retains subject matter jurisdiction over this case, does not deprive Thompson of a mode of trial to which she may speculatively be entitled to as a matter of right in another case. See Flagstar Corp., 341 S.C. at 72, 533 S.E.2d at 333 (stating the traditional analysis of subsection (2) is whether “a party is erroneously denied a trial by jury in a law case, or is erroneously required to proceed before a jury in an equity case”); see also, e.g., Woodard v.

In this case, the family court's order retaining subject matter jurisdiction over the case does not deprive Thompson of a mode of trial to which she may be entitled in the circuit court action. The two actions, though related, are separate, and the dismissal of one does not automatically impact the other.

The Supreme Court stated that the plaintiffs, who reside in Maryland and Virginia, did not allege any injury sufficient to confer standing. The Court emphasized that the plaintiffs only learned about the property transfer in Chester County, Pennsylvania, through a news release. The Court's reasoning suggests that the plaintiffs' lack of direct involvement or proximity to the community where the alleged practices occurred undermined their standing to sue. This reasoning aligns with the Sixth Circuit's decision in Washegesic v. Bloomingdale Public Schools, which recognized that individuals who are part of a community that practices offend may experience a more significant psychological impact than those who are just passing through. Therefore, the plaintiffs' residency, or lack thereof, played a crucial role in determining their standing to sue in the Valley Forge case.","The plaintiffs' residency in Maryland and Virginia in the Valley Forge case was a key factor in determining their standing to sue. The Supreme Court concluded that the plaintiffs did not allege any injury sufficient to confer standing, emphasizing their lack of direct involvement in the community where the alleged practices occurred.

Rule 11-504(B) of the NMRA 1997 establishes a psychotherapist-patient privilege, which allows a patient to prevent disclosure of confidential communications made for the purposes of diagnosis or treatment of their physical, mental, or emotional condition. This privilege extends to communications between the patient, their physician or psychotherapist, and individuals involved in the diagnosis or treatment under the direction of the physician or psychotherapist. The Supreme Court case of Jaffee further supports the existence of the psychotherapist-patient privilege.

The court's decision in Coble v. State concluded that even when the judge delegates the responsibility of excusing potential jurors to a court attendant, as long as the statutory purpose of section 607A.6 is achieved, it does not frustrate the legislative goals. Therefore, in the case of Chidester, it must be proven that the State's violation of this section caused prejudice or had a material impact on the defendant's case. According to State v. Clift, a defendant's conviction will not be reversed if they cannot demonstrate prejudice resulting from the violation of the statute. Similarly, in Martel, the court held that a defendant must show materiality in order to challenge the violation of a similar statute. As such, if Chidester cannot establish that the violation of section 607A.6 had a discernible impact on his case, the State's violation may not be considered material.","No, the violation of section 607A.6 by the State, which requires the judge to personally excuse potential jurors, does not have a material impact on the defendant's case unless the defendant can demonstrate prejudice resulting from the violation.

Regardless of whether the final structure of the deal took shape in mid-November 2000, this evidence provides an adequate basis for a rational jury to conclude that the conspiracy to artificially inflate AIG’s loss reserves and deceive the company’s investors started with Greenberg’s call to Ferguson on October 31, 2000. Lastly, Ferguson argues that the government presented insufficient evidence that a secret side agreement ensured that the LPT was a no-risk deal, and that Ferguson knew of it and agreed to it as part of the overall deal. This argument, however, is also unavailing, in light of the evidence at trial supporting both inferences. See United States v. Jones, 393 F.3d 107, 111 (2d Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>).

To establish undue influence, the first consideration is whether there was a confidential relationship, where the beneficiary had dominance over the testator. Plaintiffs argue that Wilma's involvement in administering medication and taking Jack to medical appointments, among other factors, creates a confidential relationship. In re Reddaway's Estate supports the notion that a confidential relationship can exist. While the specific weight placed on independent advice may differ between deeds and wills, it is essential to evaluate all relevant factors in assessing undue influence.","The absence of independent advice may carry greater significance in cases involving deeds than in wills when determining undue influence, as stated in Ryan v.

Carlow, 64 F.3d 1230, 1233 (8th Cir.1995) (<HOLDING>); G & C Enterprises, 62 F.3d at 36; In re",Can a forum selection clause in a contract override the venue requirement of the Miller Act?,"The question pertains to the relationship between a forum selection clause and the venue requirement of the Miller Act. Courts have consistently treated the Miller Act's venue provision as a venue requirement rather than a jurisdictional limitation. This means that venue provisions can be waived through contractual agreement. The United States Supreme Court established this principle in National Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, stating that venue provisions are subject to contractual waiver. Furthermore, three circuits, including the Eighth Circuit in FGS Constructors, Inc. v. Carlow, have specifically dealt with forum selection clauses that conflict with the Miller Act's venue provision and have concluded that, as a mere venue requirement,  the venue provision of the Miller Act can be bypassed by a valid forum selection clause. Consequently, a valid forum selection clause in a contract can override the venue requirement of the Miller Act.","Yes, a valid forum selection clause in a contract can override the venue requirement of the Miller Act, as established in National Equip. Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent and supported by the decisions in FGS Constructors, Inc. v. Carlow and other relevant cases."
"limitations period during the pendency of the original action when the original action was dismissed without prejudice for want of prosecution. Mississippi courts have never addressed this question per se. ¶ 27. Specifically, Benny cites, among others, King v. Lujan, 98 N.M. 179, 646 P.2d 1243 (1982), and Sluka v. Herman, 229 Neb. 200, 425 N.W.2d 891 (1988). In King, the New Mexico Supreme Court held that “[ajfter a consideration of the purpose and policies underlying Rule 41, we adopt the view that even though the filing of a suit ordinarily tolls the applicable limitations period, when an action is dismissed without prejudice because of a failure to prosecute, the interruption is considered as never having occurred.” King, 646 P.2d at 1244-45. Th D.La.1977) (applying Louisiana law) (<HOLDING>); Barrentine v. Vulcan Materials Co., 216 So.2d",Can the limitations period be suspended during the pendency of the original action if the action was dismissed without prejudice for want of prosecution?,"The question pertains to whether the limitations period can be suspended in the case of a dismissal without prejudice for want of prosecution. The Mississippi courts have not directly dealt with this question. However, Benny references two cases, namely King v. Lujan and Sluka v. Herman, which provide relevant guidance. In King v. Lujan, the New Mexico Supreme Court concluded that when an action is dismissed without prejudice due to failure to prosecute, the interruption caused by the filing of the suit is deemed to have never occurred. This holding is based on the analysis of Rule 41, its underlying purpose, and policies. Therefore, it can be inferred that in Mississippi, if an action is dismissed without prejudice for want of prosecution, it would not suspend the limitations period as if the suit was never filed.","No, the limitations period cannot be suspended during the pendency of the original action if the action was dismissed without prejudice for want of prosecution, based on the decision in King v. Lujan and the lack of specific Mississippi court rulings on the matter."
"may recover twice or more for some elements of damages— one from the tortfeasor who caused the harm and again from any source of benefits collateral to the tortfeasor. Such multiple recovery, however, is the by-product of the rule and not a principle of the rule itself nor a policy at the foundation of the rule.” J. Kircher, “Insurer Subrogation in Wisconsin: The Good Hands (Or A Neighbor) in Another’s Shoes,” 71 Marq. L. Rev. 33, 51-52 (1987). “The types of payments that typically come within the collateral source rule include insurance proceeds, medical benefits, and payments made by an employer pursuant to a statutory compensation scheme.” (Emphasis added.)

White, 173 Conn. 438, 448, 378 A.2d",Can a person who has suffered harm from a tortfeasor receive compensation from both the tortfeasor and any collateral sources?,"The question pertains to the applicability of the collateral source rule in cases of harm caused by a tortfeasor. The collateral source rule allows the injured party to recover compensation from both the tortfeasor who caused the harm and any collateral sources. This rule allows for multiple recovery, meaning that the injured party can receive compensation for certain elements of damages from both the tortfeasor and collateral sources. The collateral sources typically include insurance proceeds, medical benefits, and payments made by an employer under a statutory compensation scheme. It is important to note that multiple recovery is a by-product of the rule and not a fundamental principle or policy underlying the rule. The Rametta v. Stella case emphasizes the types of payments that fall within the collateral source rule, while Apuzzo v. Seneco and Healy v. White support this legal reasoning.","Yes, a person who has suffered harm from a tortfeasor can receive compensation from both the tortfeasor and any collateral sources under the collateral source rule."

Therefore, it seems that the City Council terminated Singleton simply because of the conversation between his wife and daughter. In this country, guilt is individual. We do not, as a general rule, punish A for the sins of B. Nor does the law today generally impute the actions of one spouse to another, or the actions of an adult child to the parent. See Forbes v.

In this case, the City Council members did not testify or provide any evidence to support a legitimate, good-faith belief for terminating Singleton. The absence of such evidence suggests that Singleton was terminated solely due to the conversation between his wife and daughter. The law in this country is based on the principle of individual guilt, where one person cannot be punished for the actions of another. Additionally, the law does not generally attribute the actions of one spouse to the other or the actions of an adult child to their parent. The holding in Forbes v. Arkansas Educational Television Comm'n supports this notion by stating that no general inference can be made from one spouse's opinion to that of the other. Therefore, it can be concluded that the City Council terminated Singleton without any evidence of a legitimate, good-faith belief, solely based on the conversation between his wife and daughter.","Yes, the City Council terminated Singleton solely based on the conversation between his wife and daughter without providing any evidence of a legitimate, good-faith belief."

It only excludes coverage if an employee acts with knowledge or intent to further forgery, or intentionally disregards relevant bank policies. This interpretation is supported by the Empire Bank case.","Under Georgia law, the standard for determining causation in insurance contracts is that ambiguous terms, such as ""caused,"" should be strictly construed against the insurer.

"jurisdiction the federal courts apply federal law as to matters of procedure”). As a result, any differences in procedural rules are irrelevant to the instant case. For this reason, we decline to consider the procedural discrepancies highlighted by appellants in our determination of whether the issues in the present appeal are identical to the issues presented in Canady I. Appellants additionally argue that there is no identity of issues because the state law claims covered a different time period than the federal law claims. We find this argument unpersuasive. The difference in time periods does not affect the underlying nature of the claims at issue, and therefore the difference in time periods is irrelevant in determining whether the issues were identical. See Xiong, 195 F.3d at 427 (<HOLDING>). Because appellants do not assert any",Are the procedural discrepancies between federal law and state law relevant in determining the issues in the present appeal?,"The question at hand pertains to the relevance of procedural discrepancies between federal law and state law in the present appeal. It is important to note that in cases where federal courts have jurisdiction, federal law applies to matters of procedure. As a result, any differences in procedural rules between federal law and state law are deemed irrelevant. The court's refusal to consider the procedural discrepancies raised by the appellants stems from this principle. Therefore, the issues in the present appeal should be considered identical to those presented in Canady I, regardless of any procedural disparities. The argument put forth by the appellants, stating that the state law claims covered a different time period than the federal law claims, fails to persuade the court. The court maintains that the difference in time periods has no bearing on the underlying nature of the claims in question, rendering it inconsequential in determining whether the issues were identical. This reasoning is supported by the precedent set in Xiong, where a similar holding was established. Consequently, the procedural discrepancies between federal law and state law hold no relevance in determining the issues in the present appeal.","No, the procedural discrepancies between federal law and state law are deemed irrelevant in determining the issues in the present appeal, as federal law applies to matters of procedure within federal court jurisdiction. The difference in procedural rules between federal law and state law does not impact the issues at hand, as established in Xiong, and thus, these discrepancies should not be considered in determining the identity of the issues in this case."

The statute provides a cause of action to “[w]hoever shall be injured in his business or property by reason of any violation of [section 8(b)(4)].” Once again, however, the courts have declined to give a literal meaning to the words of the statute, and in this context have set far more restrictive “standing” requirements than the statutory language, taken alone, would support.

The court recognized that expecting the Union to have this level of understanding would place them at risk of committing an unfair labor practice.

However, the dissenting opinion in this case argues for the adoption of the majority stance in federal circuits, which requires a defendant to demonstrate both actual prejudice and intentional delay for a violation of the due process clause. The dissenting opinion references Jones v. Angelone as support for this position.

"because of an imputed political opinion. Singh testified that the Indian police were interested in him because of his relationship to Khan, his domestic servant.

This reasoning is also supported by the Navas v. INS case. In this case, the Punjabi police referred to Singh as a ""traitor"" solely because of his association with Khan.

Notably, the statute uses the word",Does G.S. § 160A-48(d)(2) require a non-urban area to be adjacent to both the municipal boundary and an area developed for urban purposes for annexation?,"The question involves the interpretation of G.S. § 160A-48(d)(2) regarding the requirements for the annexation of a non-urban area. While it is a general rule that when the word ""and"" is used, it connects words or phrases in a conjunctive manner, the statute in question includes other words that influence its interpretation. The statute states that a non-urban area may be annexed if it is adjacent to 60% of its external boundary to either the municipal boundary or the boundary of an area developed for urban purposes. It does not explicitly require adjacency to both conditions. The court in Builders, Inc. held that the language used in a statute must be given full effect and not treated as mere surplusage. Therefore, based on the specific wording of G.S. § 160A-48(d)(2), a non-urban area only needs to be adjacent to either the municipal boundary or an area developed for urban purposes for annexation.","No, G.S. § 160A-48(d)(2) does not require a non-urban area to be adjacent to both the municipal boundary and an area developed for urban purposes for annexation.

However, in order to conform to the holdings in Mercado, Martinez, and Hailey, the Allen case needs to be examined. The suppression ruling in the DWI case, which prompted the question, did not have a final judgment on the merits, and jeopardy had not attached in that case. Furthermore, the ruling did not establish any specific factual findings. According to Ashe v. Swenson, a finding of fact is necessary for the appellate court to affirm the trial court's granting of the motion to suppress ruling. Therefore, it can be concluded that an appellate court cannot affirm a trial court's granting of a motion to suppress ruling if a particular fact has not been found.","No, an appellate court cannot affirm a trial court's granting of a motion to suppress ruling on a ground not raised in the trial court, as demonstrated by the Allen case and based on the requirement of a factual finding as explained in Ashe v.

"Housewares and Bekem agreed to remove an underground storage tank from the Lexington site. Housewares claims that this order “established, at most, General Housewares’ liability for part of the cost of removing the underground storage tank.” Appellant’s Brief at 13. We agree. Housewares, by agreeing to a cleanup of the Lexington site, assumed partial liability. This establishes, prima facie, that Housewares actually knew that it had incurred some liability at this site prior to the inception of the first National policy. On July 19, 1993, the EPA notified Housewares that it was a potentially responsible party (PRP) with regard to the Antrim site. The receipt of this notice does not establish actual liability. See Montrose, supra, 10 Cal.4th 645, 42 Cal. Rptr.2d 324, 913 P.2d at 904 (<HOLDING>). As its name suggests, this letter merely",Did Housewares' agreement to remove the underground storage tank establish liability for the cleanup costs?,"The question pertains to the establishment of liability for the cleanup costs incurred by Housewares. Based on the information provided, Housewares and Bekem agreed to remove the underground storage tank from the Lexington site, implying that Housewares assumed partial liability for the cost of the cleanup. As stated in Housewares' own brief, this agreement established, at most, Housewares' liability for part of the cost. Therefore, prima facie, it can be inferred that Housewares actually knew about its liability at the Lexington site before the first National policy's inception. However, the receipt of a notice from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) designating Housewares as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for the Antrim site does not necessarily establish actual liability. The Montrose case supports this determination, stating that such a notice merely indicates potential liability without conclusively establishing it.","Yes, Housewares' agreement to remove the underground storage tank established their partial liability for the cleanup costs at the Lexington site.

"without legal citation or factual evidence does not suffice to create a disputed issue of fact as to whether Form 10 was the proper form for the spin-off. Indeed, the SEC had a factual basis for rejecting the Form 10 because there was a sale of a restricted security within two years. SeraNova’s prompt and lamb-like obeisance to the SEC’s decision to require a Form S-l is strong proof that the Form 10 was the wrong document. Moreover, SeraNova brought the same bulletin to the SEC’s attention on March 17, 2000, and the SEC responded that it disagreed with SeraNova’s interpretation of the bulletin. Thus, SeraNova is left with the tenuous argument that the SEC misinterpreted its own bulletin. Cf. Sec. and Exch. Comm’n v.

In evaluating this argument, it is important to note that SeraNova's submission of Form S-1 after the SEC's rejection of Form 10 indicates their recognition that the latter was not the proper document for the spin-off. This prompt response strengthens the SEC's position that the rejection of Form 10 was justified due to the sale of a restricted security within two years. Furthermore, SeraNova's previous communication with the SEC regarding the bulletin, where the SEC disagreed with SeraNova's interpretation, weakens their argument that the SEC misunderstood its own bulletin. The legal principle established in Sec. and Exch. Comm'n v. Zandford supports the SEC's authority to interpret and enforce its own regulations. Therefore, SeraNova's argument against the SEC's decision lacks substantial merit.","No, SeraNova does not have a valid argument against the SEC's decision to require Form S-1 instead of Form 10 for the spin-off, as their prompt submission of Form S-1 and the SEC's prior disagreement with their interpretation of the bulletin weaken their argument.

"limitations period on Plaintiffs hybrid claim. 2. Federal Tolling Principles. The Ninth Circuit has not ruled on whether mental incompetency may toll federal statutes of limitations. Indeed, in Atkins v. Union Pacific Railroad Co., 685 F.2d 1146 (9th Cir.1982), the Court explicitly left open the question of whether a plaintiffs mental incompetency could toll the statute of limitations on the Federal Employer’s Liability Act. After finding that the Plaintiff had not established facts sufficient to support a finding that he was mentally incompetent, the Court stated, Because we find no issue of fact, we need not decide whether the plaintiffs in-competeney will ever toll the FELA statute of limitations. But see, Brooks v. Southern Pacific Co., 105 Ariz. 442, 445, 466 P.2d 736, 739 (1970) (<HOLDING>). Id. at 1148 (citation in original).

However, the case also references Brooks v. Southern Pacific Co., which held that mental incompetency can toll statutes of limitations. Given the lack of a clear ruling in the Ninth Circuit, there is a possibility that mental incompetency may toll federal statutes of limitations, depending on the specific circumstances and the court's interpretation.","There is no definitive ruling in the Ninth Circuit on whether a plaintiff's mental incompetency can toll federal statutes of limitations.

"interest in monitoring probationers. See Griffin, 483 U.S. at 876, 107 S.Ct. 3164. In Samson, the Supreme Court held that the state had a legitimate supervisory interest in warrantless, suspicionless searches of parolees. Samson, 126 S.Ct. at 2200-01. Specifically, this interest was considered legitimate because parolees are more likely to commit crimes in the future, and expeditious supervisory measures are required in order to prevent parolees from having the opportunity to “anticipate searches and conceal criminality.” Id. at 2201. This rationale finds foundation in the impracticability of obtaining a search warrant, a rationale similar to the underlying motivation used to support the administrative or “special needs” exception.

In both cases, the occupants of the vehicle were arrested for possession of narcotics, and the Court ruled that the offense of arrest can serve as a basis for searching the passenger compartment and any containers within the vehicle. However, it is important to note that Gant's evidentiary rationale, as established in Gant v. Arizona, would not authorize a subsequent search if the arrest was solely for a traffic offense like speeding or driving with excessively tinted windows.

"are present at the commission of the crime, it matters not by whose immediate agency the crime is committed, all are guilty. The hand of one is the. hand of all. (J.A. at 656.) In other words, the State had to prove only that Howard and Weldon, working together and with malice aforethought, were jointly responsible for Le’s death. See S.C.Code Ann. § 16-3-10 (Law Co-op.1985) (defining murder as “the killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied”). Therefore, because South Carolina does not require that a defendant have specific intent to commit murder, nothing in Howard’s original confessions was exculpatory for Fifth Amendment purposes and in no way diminished Howard’s legal blameworthiness for the murder. See State v. Foust, 479 S.E.2d 50, 51 (S.C.1996) (<HOLDING>) (citing State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352","If a defendant is present at the commission of a crime but does not directly commit it, can they still be held guilty in South Carolina?","The question pertains to the liability of a defendant who is present at the commission of a crime but does not directly commit it. According to South Carolina law, if multiple individuals are present at the commission of a crime and working together with malice aforethought, all of them can be held guilty, regardless of who actually commits the crime. This principle is based on the idea that the hand of one is the hand of all. The South Carolina Code defines murder as the killing of any person with malice aforethought, whether express or implied. Therefore, specific intent to commit murder is not required for a defendant to be held guilty. In the case of Howard, his original confessions did not provide any exculpatory evidence for Fifth Amendment purposes, and his presence at the crime scene, in conjunction with malice aforethought, establishes his legal blameworthiness for the murder. State v. Foust supports this reasoning by citing State v. Johnson.","Yes, in South Carolina, a defendant can still be held guilty if they are present at the commission of a crime, working together with malice aforethought, even if they do not directly commit the crime, as established in State v. Foust and State v. Johnson."

Additionally, in Valentine v. United States, it was determined that in determining reasonable suspicion, the totality of the circumstances includes the suspect's non-compliant conduct. In this case, Johnson's surprised and wide-eyed look upon seeing Silvers, along with his subsequent act of pushing Senquiz, led Silvers to believe that something was amiss.

According to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, a district court can only depart from the sentencing range established by the Sentencing Guidelines if it finds an aggravating or mitigating circumstance that was not adequately considered by the Sentencing Commission. In this case, the district court departed upward from the sentence because the defendant's criminal history category VI did not adequately reflect their criminal history points. This departure was justified based on the fact that the criminal history points exceeded the threshold for category VI. The United States v.

This determination is crucial in evaluating the constitutionality of the government action. If the challenged government action abridges a fundamental right or adversely affects a suspect class of persons, it must withstand strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny requires that the government action be necessary to achieve a compelling government interest and be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. On the other hand, if the challenged action does not involve a fundamental right or a suspect class, a lower level of scrutiny, such as rational basis review, may be applied. The case of State v. Andersen established that the distinction between classifications must have some relevance to the purpose for which the classification is made and the different treatments must not be arbitrary.

"differs not at all from the speculation in Hughes Properties that a jackpot might never be paid by a casino. As we observed in Hughes Properties, the potential of nonpayment of a liability always exists, and it alone does not prevent accrual. The beneficiary of a liability always has the option of waiving payment, but a taxpayer is still unquestionably entitled to deduct the liability. An injured employee entitled absolutely to reimbursement for medical services under a workers’ compensation statute, for example, may fail to utilize the medical services. The employer, however, has been held to be entitled to deduct the expected medical expenses because the workers’ compensation law creates liability. See Wien Consolidated Airlines, Inc. v.

Kilgore, 853 So.2d","Can state regulations be applied to the safety appliances, parts, and appurtenances of locomotives?","The question addresses the issue of state regulation of locomotive equipment. According to the United States Supreme Court case Napier v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co., the Federal Locomotive Inspection Act (FLIA) occupies the entire field of regulating locomotive equipment and preempts state regulation in this area. The Supreme Court held that FLIA excludes state regulation of safety appliances, parts, and appurtenances of locomotives. This means that state regulations cannot be applied to the safety aspects of locomotives since FLIA governs the regulation of locomotive design. Moreover, several courts have found that FLIA also preempts common law actions against locomotive operators and manufacturers. Therefore, it can be concluded that state regulations cannot be applied to the safety appliances, parts, and appurtenances of locomotives due to preemption by FLIA.","No, state regulations cannot be applied to the safety appliances, parts, and appurtenances of locomotives as FLIA preempts state regulation in this area, as determined in the Napier v. Atl. Coast Line R.R. Co. case."

However, in Vanyo v. Clear Channel Worldwide, the court held that the standard of review for motions to compel arbitration and stay proceedings pending arbitration in Ohio is unclear.

"numbness in both legs after he injured himself getting out of a car. His condition improved significantly after physical therapy, which helped him to walk more easily and increased his spinal flexibility. Yet, he did not regain full sensation below the knees. By the end of 2012, Gibbens reported during an examination that he was “doing well” and never experienced pain beyond five or six on a scale of ten. Our review of this mixed evidence is not intended to minimize Gibbens’s ordeal. The mere presence of “periodic improvements and cessation of treatment” cannot support an ALJ’s decision to discount the severity of a claimant’s medical condition when the ALJ fails to consider other record evidence of declining health.

According to the Gentry v. Comm’r of Soc. Sec. case, an ALJ cannot rely solely on the presence of periodic improvements and cessation of treatment to discount the severity of a claimant's medical condition. In this case, although Gibbens reported improvement and decreased pain, the ALJ must also consider other record evidence of declining health before discounting the severity of his condition.

"and misconduct on the part of the DEA, which falls under Rule 60(b)(3). Reed did not file his motion within one year after the 1992 order was entered, and accordingly, the motion was untimely. Moreover, Reed presented no new facts, arguments, or evidence to explain why he was unable to directly appeal the 1992 order or to justify the 13-year delay between the 1992 order and the 2005 Rule 60(b) motion. On this record, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying the motion. AFFIRMED. 1 . Given our resolution of the Rule 60(b) issue, we discern no abuse of the district court’s discretion in its denial of Reed's Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion to alter or amend the order denying his Rule 60(b) motion.

According to the context provided, Mr. Reed did not file his motion within one year after the 1992 order was entered, which makes his motion untimely. Additionally, Mr. Reed failed to present any new evidence or arguments to explain why he couldn't directly appeal the 1992 order or justify the 13-year delay in filing the Rule 60(b) motion.

The court first checks for any significant procedural errors. In this case, Parker argues that the district court erred by not adequately explaining the reasons for the fourteen-month sentence. The court then evaluates the substantive reasonableness of the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard. To meet this standard, the sentence must not be substantively unreasonable.

"Id. We agree with the reasoning in these cases. We thus hold that wills should be construed by the law as it existed when the testator died, thereby excluding adopted children as beneficiaries unless the will indicates an intent to include adopted children. In the instant case, the probate court determined that Jenkins did not intend to include his daughters’ adopted children as beneficiaries of his testamentary trust. In making its determination, the probate court considered the law as it existed in 1944, when Jenkins executed his will. At that time, Colorado law presumed that adopted children were not included as beneficiaries unless the testator expressly included the term “adopted children” in the will. See Brunton v. International Trust Co., 114 Colo. 298, 164 P.2d 472 (1945) (<HOLDING>). The law presumes that Jenkins knew the law in",Did Jenkins include his daughters' adopted children as beneficiaries in his testamentary trust?,"The issue at hand pertains to the construction of wills and whether adopted children should be considered beneficiaries. According to the applicable law in 1944, when Jenkins executed his will, adopted children were not automatically included as beneficiaries unless specifically mentioned. This presumption is supported by the precedent established in the case of Brunton v. International Trust Co. The probate court, considering the law prevalent at the time of Jenkins' will, evaluated his intent and concluded that he did not intend to include his daughters' adopted children as beneficiaries. Therefore, under the law existing at the time, the daughters' adopted children would not have been entitled to benefit from Jenkins' testamentary trust.","No, Jenkins did not include his daughters' adopted children as beneficiaries in his testamentary trust, as determined by the probate court based on the law and his intent at the time of executing the will."
"scope of the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure.” The order at issue requires Exmark to “identify each ... tangible item responsive to each Request for Production or by general categories of documents.” According to Exmark, the order compels it to “organize its production in a manner more restrictive than the rules allow” because it eliminated its ability to produce documents and tangible things as they are kept in the normal course of business. Under Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 196.3(c), “the responding party must either produce documents and tangible things as they are kept in the usual course of business or organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request.” Tex.R. Civ. P. 196.3(c); see In re Colonial Pipeline, 968 S.W.2d 938, 942 (Tex.1998) (orig. proceeding) (<HOLDING>). Contrary to Exmark’s argument, the rules",Does the order requiring Exmark to identify and organize its production of documents and tangible items in a certain manner violate the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure?,"The question revolves around whether the order to organize the production of documents and tangible items in a specific manner goes against the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure. Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 196.3(c) states that the responding party must either produce documents and tangible things as they are kept in the usual course of business or organize and label them to correspond with the categories in the request. In the case of In re Colonial Pipeline, the court held that this rule applies, requiring the responding party to either produce the items as they are normally organized or organize them according to the categories specified in the request. Exmark argues that the order goes beyond what the rules allow by eliminating their ability to produce the items as they are kept in the normal course of business. Based on the Texas Rule of Civil Procedure and the court's decision in In re Colonial Pipeline, it can be concluded that the order may indeed violate the rules if it restricts Exmark from producing the documents and tangible items as they are normally organized.","The order requiring Exmark to identify and organize its production of documents and tangible items in a specific manner may potentially violate the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, specifically Rule 196.3(c) and the decision in In re Colonial Pipeline."
"proceedings under state statutes prohibiting sexual, racial, religious or similar discriminatory employment practices are preempted.

"or otherwise, and no disposition, charge, encumbrance, sale or assignment of the income or of the principal of this trust or any part hereof by any beneficiary hereunder shall be of any validity or legal effect or in any way recognized by said TRUSTEE.” Because of the provisions of this classic spendthrift clause, neither Neal’s creditors nor transferees had any right to rely upon the Trust for the satisfaction of their claims. Johnson v. Morawitz, 292 F.2d 341, 344 (1961), citing In re Watts, 160 Kan. 377, 162 P.2d 82, and Sherman v. Havens, 94 Kan. at 657, 146 P. 1030. Cf. Connett v.

The trust document contains a spendthrift clause that explicitly states that no disposition, charge, encumbrance, sale, or assignment of the income or principal of the trust by any beneficiary shall be recognized by the trustee. Relying on Johnson v. Morawitz, it can be inferred that this spendthrift clause prevents Neal's creditors or transferees from having any right to rely upon the trust for the satisfaction of their claims. The case cites In re Watts and Sherman v. Havens, further reinforcing the inalienability of interests in spendthrift trusts. Additionally, the case Connett v.

"rise to a recovery under state law even in the absence of the FDCA.” Id. Courts have struggled with applying the Supreme Court’s preemption rulings to cases involving the Infuse device. Though they uniformly agree that the PMA process imposes requirements on the Infuse device, both the second step of the Riegel analysis and the scope of Buckman have prompted disagreement. This Court’s view is that some of these cases have read Riegel and Buckman — especially Buck-man — too broadly, see, e.g., Caplinger v. Medtronic, Inc., 921 F.Supp.2d 1206, 1219 (W.D.Okla.2013) (finding that fraud claims are impliedly preempted by Buckman because “even the concept of ‘off-label use’ is a creature of the FDCA”), while others have read Riegel too narrowly, see, e.g., Ramirez, 961 F.Supp.2d at 988-92 (<HOLDING>).

"the dismissal’s effect had it not been withdrawn. 6 . We rule here only that the power of the trial court to rescind an order of dismissal continues “at least” until entry of the order on the docket. That is all that is needed to dispose of this appeal.

"possession is sufficient.” Payton, 159 F.3d at 56. And we have explained that a defendant is subject to a two-level enhancement under § 2Dl.l(b)(l) for possession of a dangerous weapon if he “constructively possessed the weapon by having. dominion ... or control over the item itself, or dominion over the premises where the item [was] located.” United States v. Ortega, 94 F.3d 764, 768 (2d Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also United States v. Pellegrini, 929 F.2d 55, 56 (2d Cir.1991) (per curiam). We see no reason why, for purposes of the safety valve, possession would not similarly include constructive possession, at least where the defendant keeps the weapon under his personal dominion and control. See United States v. Bolka, 355 F.3d 909, 915-16 (6th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>). The safety valve was intended to prevent",Can constructive possession be considered as possession for the purpose of the safety valve provision?,"The question pertains to whether constructive possession can be treated as possession for the purpose of the safety valve provision. In previous cases such as United States v. Ortega and United States v. Pellegrini, the Second Circuit has established that a defendant can be subject to a two-level enhancement for possession of a dangerous weapon if they constructively possessed it by having dominion or control over the weapon or the premises where it was located. Considering that constructive possession is recognized for other enhancements, it is logical to extend this interpretation to the safety valve provision as well. This is supported by the Sixth Circuit's decision in United States v. Bolka, where it was held that constructive possession can be treated as possession for the purpose of the safety valve provision.","Yes, constructive possession can be considered as possession for the purpose of the safety valve provision, as established in United States v.

"her primary or secondary attachment figure was abruptly and inappropriately removed from her life. This potential psychological damage was the only alleged incidence of abuse, abandonment or neglect presented at the hearing. After considering the evidence and argument of counsel, the trial court found no legal basis to conclude that depriving M.N.B. of contact with Appellant, someone to whom the child has no legal connection, constitutes the level of abuse needed to support a finding of a dependency. We agree with the trial court that a parent’s decision to deprive a child of contact with someone who has no legal custody or visitation rights vis-á-vis the child is an inadequate ground upon which to base an adjudication of dependency. Cf. Clock v. Clock, 649 So.2d 312 (Fla. 3d DCA 1995) (<HOLDING>); Jones v.

The court's ruling in this case stated that the deprivation of contact, in this specific situation, did not meet the required level of abuse necessary to establish a finding of dependency for the child. The court reasoned that since the person being deprived of contact had no legal connection or rights with the child, their absence alone cannot be considered as a sufficient ground for an adjudication of dependency. The case of Clock v. Clock supports this reasoning. Therefore, simply depriving a child of contact with someone lacking legal custody or visitation rights does not meet the standard for abuse that would lead to a finding of dependency.","No, a parent's decision to deprive a child of contact with someone who has no legal custody or visitation rights cannot be considered as abuse that would support a finding of dependency, as established in this case and supported by the ruling in Clock v.

"the Miles court did note with respect to the Jones Act that it “sailed in occupied waters ... and was not free to expand remedies at will simply because it might work to the benefit of seamen and those dependent upon them”, id., 498 U.S. at -, 111 S.Ct. at 327. As defendants here correctly point out, however, the impact of the considered and settled decision in Miles is to render it anomalous to award the nondependent survivor of a nonseaman a recovery which is patently denied to the nondependent beneficiary of a well-deserving seaman. In effect, to allow plaintiffs to recover wrongful death damages here simply because their son was not a Jones Act seaman would ironically, and improperly, leave the relatives of seamen as a less-favored class under admiralty.

However, it is argued by the defendants that denying recovery to the nondependent survivor of a nonseaman while allowing recovery for the nondependent beneficiary of a well-deserving seaman would create an unjust discrepancy. Allowing plaintiffs to recover in this case, based on the fact that their son was not a Jones Act seaman, would ironically place the relatives of seamen in a less-favored position under admiralty law.

That cannot be said to be the case here, especially in view of the fact that the “prior restraint” cases cited in the plaintiffs’ appellate briefs simply are not applicable to the facts of this case. Hence, even if the issue had been squarely presented, we could not find in the plaintiffs’ favor based on the authority submitted on appeal. There remains the equal protection question, which is raised here under the Fifth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The district court held that the claim was non-cognizable because the Equal Protection Clause protects against inappropriate classifications of people, rather than things. This position has been adopted by several courts. See, e.g., Benjamin v. Bailey, 234 Conn. 455, 662 A.2d 1226 (1995)(<HOLDING>); California Rifle & Pistol Ass’n v. City of",Can the plaintiffs argue a violation of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause in this case?,"In this case, the plaintiffs have raised a question regarding equal protection under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.

Therefore, based on the authority submitted on appeal, even if the issue had been squarely presented, the plaintiffs cannot find a favorable outcome in their argument of an equal protection violation.","No, the plaintiffs cannot argue a violation of equal protection under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause in this case, as it has been established by the district court and supported by other courts that the Equal Protection Clause protects against inappropriate classifications of people, rather than things."
"the court. Mussivand, 544 N.E.2d at 270. The existence of a duty “depends upon the foreseeability of harm: if a reasonably prudent person would have on take an affirmative action to aid or protect another, unless there is a “special and definite” relationship between the parties. Id. (citing Estates of Morgan v. Fairfield Family Counseling Ctr., 77 Ohio St.3d 284, 673 N.E.2d 1311, 1319 (1997)). However, the government must exercise reasonable care in performing responsibilities it has assumed and “conform to the standards which it sets for itself.” Dreyer v.

In Freeman, the Sixth Circuit held that",Is the government obligated to exercise reasonable care and conform to their own set standards when performing their responsibilities?,"The question revolves around the duty of the government to exercise reasonable care and adhere to the standards it has established for itself. According to the case of Dreyer v. United States, the government is expected to exercise reasonable care when performing its responsibilities and must conform to the standards it sets for itself. Foreseeability of harm plays a crucial role in determining the existence of a duty. If it is reasonably foreseeable that harm could occur, a duty to take affirmative action to aid or protect another may arise, unless there is a ""special and definite"" relationship between the parties. This principle was established in the Estates of Morgan v. Fairfield Family Counseling Center case. Therefore, it is expected that the government acts with reasonable care and adheres to its own standards in fulfilling its responsibilities.","Yes, the government is obligated to exercise reasonable care and conform to its own set standards when performing its responsibilities, as stated in the Dreyer v. United States case. This is based on the principle that the government must exercise reasonable care and adhere to the standards it sets for itself."
"to strike are pending. In such circumstances, the trial court is given the limited jurisdiction to rule on the merits of the motion in order to decide if it should award attorney fees and costs to the defendants.”). The reasoning for this retention of limited jurisdiction makes intuitive sense.’As the court in Col-train v. Shewalter explained, a voluntary dismissal should not automatically preclude an award of attorneys’ fees to a defendant because [ojtherwise, SLAPP plaintiffs could achieve most of their objective with little risk — by filing a SLAPP suit, forcing the defendant to incur the effort and expense of preparing a special motion to strike, then dismissing the action without prejudice. The specter of the action being refiled (at ptr.2d 807 (1999), as modified (Feb. 5, 1999) (<HOLDING>); eCash Techs., Inc. v. Guagliardo, 127",Can a defendant be awarded attorney fees and costs in a case where the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the lawsuit without prejudice?,"The question revolves around the award of attorney fees and costs in a situation where the plaintiff voluntarily dismisses the lawsuit without prejudice. According to the court's decision in Col-train v. Shewalter, a voluntary dismissal should not automatically prevent a defendant from being awarded attorney fees. Allowing this would create an opportunity for SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) plaintiffs to achieve their objectives with minimal risk. They could file a SLAPP suit, forcing the defendant to incur expenses in preparing a special motion to strike, and then dismiss the case without prejudice. The possibility of the case being refiled keeps the defendant under the pressure of potential litigation, causing financial burden and deterrence. Therefore, the court retains limited jurisdiction in these circumstances to rule on the merits of the motion and determine whether attorney fees and costs should be awarded to the defendant.","No, a plaintiff voluntarily dismissing a lawsuit without prejudice does not automatically preclude a defendant from being awarded attorney fees and costs. The court retains limited jurisdiction in such cases to decide if the defendant should be awarded attorney fees and costs, as established in the Col-train v. Shewalter case."

"was conscious of the confinement, (3) the plaintiff did not contest the confinement, and (4) the confinement was not otherwise privileged.” Broughton v. State, 37 N.Y.2d 451, 456, 373 N.Y.S.2d 87, 335 N.E.2d 310 (1975), cert. denied, 423 U.S. 929, 96 S.Ct. 277, 46 L.Ed.2d 257 (1975) (internal citations omitted). The only element in dispute in the instant case is the last element — defendant argues that the arrest was privileged as a matter of law because it was supported by probable cause. Fulton v. Robinson, 289 F.3d 188, 195 (2d. Cir.2002) (“A § 1983 claim of false arrest based on the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures may not be maintained if there was probable cause for the arrest”); see also Bernard v. United States, 25 F.3d 98, 102 (2d Cir. 1994) (<HOLDING>); Cameron v. Fogarty, 806 F.2d 380, 387 (2d","As a non-legal professional, I would like to understand if the arrest made in this case can be considered privileged if it was supported by probable cause?","The issue at hand is whether the arrest in question can be considered privileged if it was supported by probable cause. According to Broughton v. State, for an arrest to be considered privileged, all four elements need to be fulfilled. These elements include (1) an intention to confine, (2) the individual being conscious of the confinement, (3) no contestation of the confinement by the plaintiff, and (4) the absence of any other privilege that would justify the confinement. In the present case, the sole element in dispute is the fourth one. The defendant argues that the arrest was privileged as a matter of law because there was probable cause to support it. Under the Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizures, a claim of false arrest cannot be sustained if there was probable cause for the arrest, as established in Fulton v. Robinson. Therefore, if it can be proven that there was probable cause for the arrest, it can be considered privileged and not an unlawful confinement.","Yes, if it can be established that the arrest was supported by probable cause, it can be considered privileged and not an unlawful confinement, in accordance with the decision in Fulton v. Robinson."

Plaintiff alleges that Voorthuis Optician’s insistence that she report to work in the District of Columbia, where her medical malpractice coverage may not have applied, created an intolerable work condition that forced her to resign. Am. Compl. at ¶ 36. Even assuming that plaintiffs resignation was occasioned by conduct “so outrageous in character and so extreme in degree, as to go beyond all possible bounds of decency, and to be regarded as atrocious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized community,” plaintiff failed to identify a specific statute which defendants violated by asking her to report to work in the District of Columbia. See Johnson v. Behsudi, 52 Va. Cir. 533, 538 (Va. Cir. Ct.1997) (<HOLDING>). Consequently, plaintiffs claim of",Did Voorthuis Optician violate any specific statute by insisting that the plaintiff report to work in the District of Columbia?,"The question pertains to whether Voorthuis Optician violated any specific statute by asking the plaintiff to report to work in the District of Columbia. According to the Johnson v. Behsudi case, to establish a claim of outrageous conduct, the plaintiff must identify a specific statute that the defendants violated. In this case, the plaintiff failed to identify any specific statute that Voorthuis Optician violated by insisting on her reporting to work in the District of Columbia. Therefore, there is no basis for the claim that Voorthuis Optician violated a specific statute, regardless of the perceived intolerable work condition created.","No, Voorthuis Optician did not violate any specific statute by insisting that the plaintiff report to work in the District of Columbia, as the plaintiff failed to identify any specific statute that was violated in this situation."
"McDonough has failed to produce evidence to show that she was substantially limited in the major life activity of walking. Walking is considered a major life activity. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(i) (2011). However, it is undisputed that McDonough could walk continuously for one hour a day and intermittently for four hours a day. Moreover, McDonough spent two hours a day delivering mail, walking fifteen to twenty minutes non-stop. She also walked up and down the stairs in her home. For exercise, she would walk to a nearby lake and she even went to the gym a couple of times each week to take part in a water walking therapy class. As a matter of law, this evidence does not support McDonough’s disability claim. See, e.g., Neal v. Kraft Foods Global, Inc., 379 Fed.Appx. 632, 634 (9th Cir.2010) (<HOLDING>); see also Turner v. The Saloon, Ltd., 595 F.3d","Based on the evidence provided, does McDonough's claim meet the criteria for disability?","In order for McDonough's claim to be considered a disability claim, she must demonstrate that she is substantially limited in a major life activity, specifically walking. According to the evidence presented, McDonough is able to continuously walk for one hour a day and intermittently for four hours a day. She is also able to walk for fifteen to twenty minutes non-stop while delivering mail and regularly engages in walking activities for exercise. Additionally, she attends water walking therapy classes at the gym multiple times a week. Based on this evidence, it can be concluded that McDonough's ability to walk is not substantially limited and therefore, her claim does not meet the criteria for disability as a matter of law.","No, based on the evidence provided, McDonough's claim does not meet the criteria for disability as her ability to walk is not substantially limited.

This paragraph constitutes Madison’s entire argument on this issue. The circuit court when denying relief stated: “Madison does not argue his appellate counsel was disbarred because of his performance in Madison’s case nor does he proffer any facts in his Rule 32 petition indicating how he was prejudiced due to his appellate counsel being disbarred.

However, the circuit court, when denying relief, pointed out that the petitioner did not provide any argument or facts indicating how he was prejudiced due to his appellate counsel being disbarred. In the case of Adkins v. State, it was established that the petitioner must demonstrate prejudice as a result of the disbarment of appellate counsel. Since the petitioner has failed to provide any evidence of prejudice, it can be concluded that his argument lacks sufficient legal basis.","No, the failure of appellate counsel to adequately supplement the record and challenge the competency of trial counsel does not constitute a violation of the petitioner's constitutional rights unless the petitioner can demonstrate prejudice as a result of the disbarment of appellate counsel, as established in Adkins v.

"that the timing of the wife’s complaints, three months after the alleged threatening calls, as well as the timing of Anura’s application for asylum and generation of documents mere weeks before the deadline, appeared to be the creation of evidence rather than the credible recitation of events. The record does not compel the opposite conclusion. See, e.g., Pal v. INS, 204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000). Further, the IJ found that even if Anura had been credible in his account of the alleged threatening incidents, they would not have amounted to past persecution. Threats standing alone “constitute past persecution in only a small category of cases, and only when the threats are so menacing as to cause significant actual ‘suffering or harm.’ ” Lim v. INS, 224 F.3d 929, 936 (9th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). The IJ also reasonably discounted Anura’s","Based on the timing of events and the credibility of the evidence, can it be concluded that the wife's complaints and Anura's application for asylum were attempts to create evidence rather than genuine accounts of events?","In evaluating the credibility of the wife's complaints and Anura's application for asylum, the timing of these events becomes crucial. The record suggests that the wife's complaints were made three months after the alleged threatening calls, and Anura's application for asylum and generation of documents occurred mere weeks before the deadline. This timing raises doubts about the authenticity of the events and raises the possibility that they were created as a means to support their case. The court in Pal v. INS established that such timing can be indicative of evidence creation rather than genuine recitation of events. Furthermore, even if the threats mentioned by Anura were considered credible, it is important to note that threats alone do not necessarily constitute past persecution unless they cause significant suffering or harm. This principle was established in Lim v. INS. Therefore, considering the timing of events, the doubts about credibility, and the legal standards for classifying threats as persecution, it can be reasonably concluded that the wife's complaints and Anura's application for asylum may indeed be attempts to create evidence, rather than genuine accounts of events.","Yes, based on the timing of events and the principles established in Pal v. INS and Lim v. INS, there are reasonable grounds to conclude that the wife's complaints and Anura's application for asylum were potentially efforts to create evidence rather than genuine recitations of events."

Hamlet, 456 F.2d at 1285; Theriault, 440 F.2d at 715. However, the guarantees of section 3006A(e) are distinct in at least one important respect: the statute provides a defendant expert assistance for preparation for his trial, and provision of those statutory guarantees therefore takes on a constitutional dimension not present in collateral habeas corpus proceedings. Compare Theriault, 440 F.2d at 716-717 (Wisdom, J., concurring) (invoking indigent criminal defendant’s constitutional right to court-appointed experts to assist with defense) with Murray v.

In the case of section 3006A(e), the statute grants defendants the right to receive expert assistance for trial preparation. This guarantee takes on a constitutional dimension because it directly relates to the defendant's constitutional right to court-appointed experts for assistance with their defense. This constitutional right is not present in collateral habeas corpus proceedings. In the Theriault case, Judge Wisdom, in his concurrence, invoked the constitutional right of an indigent criminal defendant to court-appointed experts. However, in the Murray v. Giarratano case, the Supreme Court held that there was no constitutional requirement to provide such expert assistance in collateral habeas corpus proceedings. Therefore, the guarantees under section 3006A(e) provide constitutional protection for indigent defendants seeking expert assistance for trial preparation.","The distinction between the guarantees of section 3006A(e) and collateral habeas corpus proceedings lies in the fact that section 3006A(e) grants indigent criminal defendants the constitutional right to court-appointed experts for trial preparation, while collateral habeas corpus proceedings do not require the provision of such expert assistance. This distinction was established in the Theriault and Murray v. Giarratano cases."

"here confirm that Officer Cuellar’s first approach to Reyes to ascertain whether he could render assistance was purely a consensual encounter from which Reyes was free to walk away. However, this encounter evolved into an investigatory stop when, upon approaching Reyes, Officer Cuellar noticed that the scooter had no key and that Reyes was nervous and sweating. These observations, combined with the time of day; the fact that Reyes was coming from the direction of a scooter store; Officer Cuellar’s knowledge of recent scooter thefts in the area; and Reyes’ statements that the scooter belonged to a friend whose last name and address he did not know, all gave rise to a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity might be afoot.

Firstly, they claim that the government made inflammatory appeals to sympathy for a particular individual and played on the jurors' fears regarding the defendant's potential harm to other children. Secondly, the defendant contends that the government minimized the burden of proof.

"North Carolina is commonly called an “absolute” jurisdiction, but its holdings that refusal cannot be reconsidered involve consent given outside the thirty-minute period. See Etheridge v. Peters, 269 S.E.2d 133, 136 (N.C. 1980) (finding willful refusal to submit to test after statutory thirty-minute period had expired); Seders v. Powell, 259 S.E.2d 544, 548-50 (N.C. 1979) (same). These cases do not make clear whether an operator may reconsider a refusal within the thirty-minute period. ¶ 18. The many courts that allow operators to reconsider a refusal coalesce around two rationales: (1) fairness to the operator, and (2) furthering the purpose of implied-consent statutes by encouraging the administration of chemical tests in as many cases as possible.

In North Carolina, the state is commonly referred to as an ""absolute"" jurisdiction, meaning that once the thirty-minute period has expired, a willful refusal to undergo the test will be considered. This is evident in the cases of Etheridge v. Peters and Seders v. Powell, where refusal after the statutory thirty-minute period had expired was found to be willful. However, it is unclear from these cases whether an operator can reconsider their refusal within the thirty-minute window. Many other jurisdictions allow for operators to reconsider their refusal within this period, based on the principles of fairness to the operator and the promotion of the purpose of implied-consent statutes, which encourage the administration of chemical tests in as many cases as possible. Therefore, it remains uncertain whether an operator in North Carolina can reconsider their refusal within the thirty-minute period.","The ability for an operator to reconsider their refusal to submit to a chemical test within the thirty-minute period in North Carolina is unclear, as there is no clear precedent in the existing case law."

Furthermore, Appellant acknowledged that his civilian attorney told him not to go into questioning without him and Appellant intentionally ignored that advice. Based on Appellant’s own testimony and actions in reviewing and signing the Article 31, UCMJ, rights form at the time of the interrogation, Appellant waived any right he may have had to have his counsel notified of and be present at the interrogation.

In this case, the appellant waived his right to consult with either a civilian lawyer or a military lawyer before the interrogation. This waiver is evident from the appellant's initials on the written waiver form. Additionally, during the trial, the appellant acknowledged this waiver when questioned by the military judge. The appellant himself admitted that his civilian attorney advised him against proceeding with the questioning without the presence of counsel, but the appellant intentionally ignored this advice. Based on the appellant's testimony and actions, it can be concluded that he waived his right to have his counsel notified of and present at the interrogation. The LeMasters case supports this reasoning, stating that an individual's review and signing of the Article 31, UCMJ, rights form during the interrogation signifies the waiver of any right to counsel. Consequently, the presence of the appellant's counsel at the interrogation is not permissible due to the appellant's explicit waiver.","No, the appellant's counsel cannot be present at the interrogation because the appellant explicitly waived his right to consult with a lawyer prior to questioning, as evidenced by his initials on the waiver form and his acknowledgment of the waiver during the trial.

"at 467 (describing the practical problems that would ensue if tolling were not permitted in opt-in class actions). It also would place on the court the burden of timing class certification and implementing opt-in procedures in such a way as to make sure that the limitations period was met.

Rhutasel et al. at 11-12 (unintentional procedural delays in ruling on class certification would terminate putative class members’ claims if tolling did not permit putative members to opt in to a representative suit after the statute of limitations had run).

Finally, we agree with the reasoning of the",How does allowing tolling in opt-in class actions help address practical problems related to timing class certification and implementing opt-in procedures?,"The question revolves around the concept of tolling in opt-in class actions and its impact on practical issues. Tolling refers to the suspension or extension of the statute of limitations in certain circumstances. In this case, allowing tolling in opt-in class actions is crucial because it addresses practical problems that would arise if tolling were not permitted. Without tolling, the court would bear the burden of timing class certification and implementing opt-in procedures in a way that ensures the limitations period is met, which would be virtually impossible in cases like this where the lawsuit was filed late. Allowing tolling in opt-in class actions also prevents unintentional procedural delays in ruling on class certification from terminating putative class members' claims. This means that putative members can still join a representative suit even after the statute of limitations has expired, avoiding an anomalous difference in the treatment of potential class members. Therefore, allowing tolling in opt-in class actions helps to manage practical issues and ensure a fair process for potential class members.","Allowing tolling in opt-in class actions helps to address practical problems related to timing class certification and implementing opt-in procedures, such as avoiding difficulties in meeting the limitations period, preventing the termination of potential class members' claims due to procedural delays, and avoiding an anomalous difference in the treatment of potential class members."

It has been established in the case of Gardner v. United States that suits for libel or slander are prohibited under the FTCA. Therefore, the plaintiff's defamation claim against the United States would be barred under this Act. Additionally, the D.C. Council, not Congress, enacted the D.C. Human Rights Act (DCHRA), and there is no federal statute indicating Congress's intent to waive the United States' immunity from suit under the DCHRA. Consequently, the plaintiff's DCHRA claim should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, as ruled in the case of Marcus. Thus, the plaintiff cannot pursue defamation and misrepresentation claims against the United States under the FTCA or the DCHRA.","No, the plaintiff cannot pursue defamation and misrepresentation claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act, as established in the case of Gardner v.

Frederick v. Action Tire Co., 744 A.2d 762, 766 (Pa.Super.Ct.1999). We agree with defendant that decisions of the Worker’s Compensation Appeal Board may preclude relitigation of the same issue, that is the causation of plaintiffs injuries. See, e.g., id. (<HOLDING>).

According to the PVA, a national of a foreign country can only sue under the Act if the government of that foreign country would permit a United States national to bring the same suit in its courts. This reciprocity requirement ensures that the waiver of sovereign immunity is contingent upon equivalent rights being provided by the foreign government to United States nationals.

Therefore, McClellan lacks standing to appeal the bankruptcy court's order.","No, McClellan cannot appeal the bankruptcy court's order regarding the agreement due to a lack of standing."
"§ 20.2b, at 906 n. 21 (5th ed.2005). And, finally, the petitioner argues that the district court was required to grant her request for an evidentiary hearing under Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 312-13, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963). As a matter of statutory law, we reject the Commonwealth’s importunings. Here, the petitioner adduced extensive evidence in the state court. The exact manner in which she elected to make the point is less important than the fact that she did make the point; her proffer went directly to the merits of the claims that she later sought to pursue in the federal court proceedings. We conclude, therefore, that the district court was not statutorily prohibited from taking evidence on those claims. See Bryan v. Mullin, 335 F.3d 1207, 1215 (10th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Matheney v. Anderson, 253 F.3d 1025, 1039",Can the district court grant an evidentiary hearing in the federal court proceedings despite extensive evidence presented by the petitioner in the state court?,"The question pertains to whether the district court has the authority to grant the petitioner's request for an evidentiary hearing in the federal court proceedings. The petitioner argues that the request should be granted based on the precedent set by Townsend v. Sain, which establishes that a request for an evidentiary hearing should be granted under certain circumstances. While the Commonwealth argues against it, the fact that the petitioner presented extensive evidence in the state court supports the notion that the district court should not be prohibited from taking evidence on the claims. This is in line with the rulings in Bryan v. Mullin and Matheney v. Anderson, which maintain that the district court has the authority to assess the evidence regardless of previous presentations in the state court.","Yes, the district court can grant an evidentiary hearing in the federal court proceedings despite the petitioner presenting extensive evidence in the state court, as established in Bryan v.

Wyatt further supports this idea by stating that if a defendant had been arrested before being asked if they had been drinking, Miranda warnings would be necessary. Additionally, State v. Amorin clarifies that once a person is arrested, they are considered to be in the custody of the police. However, it should be noted that State v. Nakoa and State v.

"Minnesota Loan & Trust Co., 17 N.D. 409, 117 N.W. 354, 357 (1908). A statutory dedication is “in the nature of a grant,” while a common-law dedication “rests upon the principles of estoppel in pais.” Cole, at 357. The dedication, therefore, is regarded not as transferring a right, but as operating to preclude the owner from resuming his right of private property, or indeed any use inconsistent with the public use. The ground of the estoppel is that to reclaim the land would be a violation of good faith to the public and to those who have acquired private property with a view to the enjoyment of the use contemplated by the dedication.

According to the Minnesota Loan & Trust Co. case, a common-law dedication is based on estoppel in pais and does not transfer the rights of the landowner, but rather operates to prevent the landowner from resuming private property rights or using the land in a way that contradicts the public use. The principle behind the estoppel is that reclaiming the land would violate good faith towards the public and those who have acquired private property with the expectation of enjoying the dedicated use. Supported by the Ark. State Highway Comm. v. Sherry case and the Whittom v. Alexander-Richardson Partnership case, it is evident that once land has been dedicated through common-law dedication, the landowner cannot reclaim it.","No, once land has been dedicated to public use through common-law dedication, the landowner cannot reclaim it, as it would violate good faith towards the public and those who have relied on the dedication for their own property enjoyment.

According to the Supreme Court case of Anderson v. Creighton, before proceeding with discovery, it must be determined whether the actions alleged by the plaintiffs are actions that a reasonable officer could have believed to be lawful. If the actions meet this standard, the officer is entitled to dismissal prior to discovery. However, if the officer's claimed actions differ from the actions alleged by the plaintiffs, and those claimed actions are actions that a reasonable officer could have believed lawful, then discovery may be necessary to resolve the officer's motion for summary judgment based on qualified immunity. It is important to note that any discovery should be focused specifically on the question of the officer's qualified immunity. The Kulwicki v.

There is no indication that, in formulating the “expressly retained” standard, Congress intended to upset settled doctrine and to impose on the Federal Government a more or less demanding standard than the one reflected in those cases, see, e. g., Holt State Bank, supra, at 55 (<HOLDING>), and carried forward in Montana and Utah Div.",Is it possible that the Act passed by Congress imposes a more demanding standard on the Federal Government regarding the retention of equal footing lands than what is reflected in settled doctrine?,"The question pertains to whether the Act passed by Congress imposes a more demanding standard on the Federal Government with regards to the retention of equal footing lands.

The Court emphasizes that the Act's terms encompass lands subject to the equal footing doctrine and those beneath the territorial sea, further supporting the idea that the Act reinforces the existing equal footing doctrine. Moreover, the Court notes that Congress would have enacted the Act against the background of settled doctrine and there is no indication that Congress intended to deviate from the standard established by previous cases. Accordingly, it can be inferred that Congress did not intend to impose a more or less demanding standard on the Federal Government through the ""expressly retained"" provision of the Act.","No, the Act passed by Congress does not impose a more demanding standard on the Federal Government regarding the retention of equal footing lands compared to what is reflected in settled doctrine, as determined in the Montana, Utah Div, and Holt State Bank cases."

Although the court recognized the potential for such fees to render an arbitration agreement unconscionable, it rejected the plaintiff's contention in Lyster that the cost and fees provision of the arbitration agreement at hand was unconscionable based on Missouri law governing unconscionability. The court cited the Green Tree Financial Corp.-Alabama v. Randolph case, which supports the idea that the establishment of undue harshness in the terms of an agreement is necessary to establish unconscionability. Therefore, in order to determine whether a cost and fees provision in an arbitration agreement is unconscionable, it is crucial to evaluate the specific terms of the agreement and consider the relevant laws in the jurisdiction.","The determination of whether a cost and fees provision in an arbitration agreement is unconscionable depends on the specific terms of the agreement and the applicable laws governing unconscionability.

"original sentence hearing went no further than “at least 1.5 kilograms.” If so, that finding is not specific enough to support any conclusion about whether Amendment 750 lowered Hamilton’s base offense level, because “at least 1.5 kilograms” is equally consist tent with a finding of 8.4 kilograms or more and a finding of less than 8.4 kilograms. So if the district court finds that its original findings were limited to “at least 1.5 kilograms,” the court will need to go further. It will need to examine the entire record before it at the time of the original sentencing to see if it can make any further findings that will resolve the issue of whether 8.4 kilograms or more of crack cocaine should be attributed to Hamilton. See, e.g., United States v. Moore, 582 F.3d 641, 646 (6th Cir.2009) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

Moore, the Sixth Circuit held that when the original findings of the court were limited to ""at least 1.5 kilograms,"" it becomes necessary for the court to examine the entire record at the time of the original sentencing. By doing so, the court can make additional findings that will clarify whether the amount of crack cocaine should be considered as 8.4 kilograms or more.

"that the presumption of immunity creates an “unusual” standard for summary judgment. As the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit observed, [T]he rebuttable presumption ... creates an unusual summary judgment standard that can best be expressed as follows: “Might a reasonable jury, viewing the facts in the best light for [the plaintiff], conclude that he has shown, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the defendants’ actions are outside the scope of § 11112(a)?” If not, the court should grant the defendant’s motion.

Firstly, it allows the IRS to regulate offshore banking activities by monitoring and collecting information about these accounts. Secondly, it ensures that individuals with foreign bank accounts comply with tax obligations and disclose their assets and income accurately. Lastly, these reporting requirements enable individuals to access their foreign bank accounts since certain information is necessary to establish and maintain these accounts.

However, in the present case, the fraud had a real victim in its sights but was interrupted before any harm was done. This distinguishes it from the Galbraith case. Other relevant cases such as United States v. Coffman and United States v. Falcioni support this reasoning by noting that the lack of loss in a fraud case may be due to the actions of law enforcement or the chance intervention of a third party, rather than the non-existence of the intended victim.

"which Hinton and Wachovia agreed states that if Hinton breaches, Wachovia is entitled to foreclose on the property. On this basis, Wachovia contends that it was entitled to reject Hinton’s October payment and initiate foreclosure proceedings on the home. Hinton’s claim that Wachovia breached the May DFA by failing to state a sum certain for the “regular payment” amount is without merit. Hinton cites no authority for this proposition, and we have found none. An ambiguous term in the contract does not amount to a breach by the drafter. Rather, a significant disagreement over the meaning of a contract term could vitiate mutual assent, and thus no contract would ever have been formed. See Higgins v.

"Moreover, although the Burberry Check mark does not include an equestrian knight, it is undisputed that Burberry has obtained trademark protection for an equestrian knight mark, and that it often sells handbags and other goods displaying a combination of the two marks. It is also undisputed that Appellants used their mark on handbags — the same category of goods on which Burberry used its marks. The district court was therefore correct to afford the jury the opportunity to view the government’s evidence and form an independent conclusion regarding whether Appellants’ plaid design was substantially indistinguishable from the Burberry Check mark and whether the inclusion of the equestrian knight figure made any difference. See United States v. Yi, 460 F.3d 623, 629 n. 4 (5th Cir.2006)(<HOLDING>). And this evidence was sufficient to support",Is the inclusion of the equestrian knight figure in Appellants' plaid design a significant factor in determining whether it is substantially indistinguishable from the Burberry Check mark?,"The question pertains to whether the inclusion of the equestrian knight figure in Appellants' plaid design is a relevant factor in determining its similarity to the Burberry Check mark. The court in United States v. Yi established that it is within the jury's purview to examine the evidence presented by the government and independently conclude whether Appellants' plaid design is substantially indistinguishable from the Burberry Check mark, taking into consideration the presence of the equestrian knight figure. Since Burberry has obtained trademark protection for the equestrian knight mark and frequently sells goods that combine both marks, it can be argued that the inclusion of the equestrian knight figure may impact the overall similarity between the two designs. Therefore, the district court was correct in allowing the jury to evaluate the evidence and make a determination based on its findings.","The inclusion of the equestrian knight figure in Appellants' plaid design could be a significant factor in determining whether it is substantially indistinguishable from the Burberry Check mark, as established in United States v.

".4 (providing for fines and imprisonment for acting as an attorney without authority). The fourth and final factor concerns the nexus between the lack of license and the contract at issue. In the present case, there is an undeniably direct connection. The performance for which Bergantzel seeks compensation is the unauthorized practice of law, conduct that she was prohibited by law from performing. In other words, the unlicensed conduct is not a collateral matter. Weighing all the factors, we conclude that the interest in refusing to enforce the contract must prevail. The fact that Ber-gantzel has already performed and, in that sense, Mlynarik will receive a windfall, simply does not outweigh the strong public policy against the unauthorized practice of law. See Meunier, 170 So. at 578 (<HOLDING>). Accordingly, we conclude that the contract is",Can Bergantzel seek compensation for the performance of unauthorized practice of law?,"The question pertains to whether Bergantzel can seek compensation for engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. In this case, it is evident that Bergantzel performed services that constitute the unauthorized practice of law, which is prohibited by law. The court considers multiple factors to determine whether to enforce the contract, including the lack of a valid license, the nature of the conduct, and the nexus between the lack of license and the contract. In this situation, there is a direct connection between the lack of license and the performance for which Bergantzel seeks compensation. As a result, the court concludes that the public policy against the unauthorized practice of law prevails over any interest in enforcing the contract. Even though Mlynarik may receive a windfall from Bergantzel's performance, it does not outweigh the strong public policy considerations. Therefore, Bergantzel cannot seek compensation for her unauthorized practice of law.","No, Bergantzel cannot seek compensation for her performance of the unauthorized practice of law due to the strong public policy against such conduct, as evidenced by the court's decision."

Boyd’s additional argument, that he was entitled to a separate trial because of Easter-ling's and Travis's testimony that they knew Boyd from selling drugs, has no merit. This could have come in even in a separate trial. For example, the testimony that Easterling blurted — that he and Boyd ""used to hustle together” — came in as the prosecutor was asking questions designed to elicit that “a person who actually knew [Easterling] [and presumably knew that Easterling sometimes had large sums of cash] was Brian Boyd.” 11 .

The court has the authority to divide the marital estate based on equitable considerations. Only if it can be established that the court abused its discretion or made an unreasonable decision will an appellate court overturn the trial court's order. This means that the appellate court will not interfere with the trial court's decision unless it is found to be clearly erroneous or against the interests of justice. Therefore, if it can be demonstrated that the trial court in this case abused its discretion in dividing the marital estate, the order can be overturned on appeal. This legal reasoning is supported by the Teel v. Teel and Johnson v.

"v. Rushen, 705 F.2d 355, 357 (9th Cir.1983) (quoting Powell v. Spalding, 679 F.2d 163, 166 (9th Cir.1982)). We are not persuaded that the trial court committed such an error. The Eighth Circuit considered a similar situation in Futrell v. Wyrick, 716 F.2d 1207 (8th Cir.1983). There, an unsuccessful habeas petitioner claimed that the introduction of police mugshots at his trial violated his due process rights. The court of appeals disagreed. “The manner in which the photographs were introduced,” the court found, “was unexceptionable. The photographs were never referred to as ‘mugshots’ and all police data was removed from them.” Id. at 1208. Thus, their introduction did not violate notions of fundamental fairness. Id.; see also United States v. Terry, 760 F.2d 939, 944 (9th Cir.1985) (<HOLDING>). The photographs in Reiger’s case did not",Can the introduction of police mugshots in a trial violate a defendant's due process rights?,"The question pertains to the admissibility of police mugshots as evidence in a trial. In the case of Futrell v. Wyrick, the Eighth Circuit held that the introduction of police mugshots in a trial does not violate a defendant's due process rights if the manner in which the photographs are presented is unobjectionable. The court found that as long as the photographs are not referred to as 'mugshots' and all police data is removed from them, their introduction does not go against the principles of fundamental fairness. This reasoning aligns with the decision in Powell v. Spalding, where it was established that the prejudicial effect of introducing mugshots depends on their content and the manner in which they are presented. Therefore, if the same standards were applied in the present case, the introduction of the police mugshots would be deemed permissible.","No, the introduction of police mugshots in a trial does not violate a defendant's due process rights as long as they are not referred to as 'mugshots' and all police data is removed from them, as established in Futrell v.

The [Free Exercise] Clause forbids subtle departures from neutrality and covert suppression of particular religious beliefs.” (internal quotation marks and citations omitted)). In reaching this conclusion we do not suggest that “every religious sect or group within a prison— however few in number — must have identical facilities or personnel.” Cruz v. Beto, 405 U.S. 319, 322 n. 2, 92 S.Ct. 1079, 31 L.Ed.2d 263 (1972).

In the case of Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah, the Supreme Court emphasized that the Free Exercise Clause prohibits not only overt discrimination but also subtle departures from neutrality and covert suppression of particular religious beliefs. According to the Court, ensuring facial neutrality is essential in upholding the rights of individuals to freely practice their religion. While it does not require identical facilities or personnel for every religious group within a prison, Turner v. Safley establishes that neutrality must be maintained unless there is a legitimate penological interest that justifies its absence. The Thornburgh v. Abbott case further supports the notion that neutrality must be ensured or sufficiently explained to warrant summary judgment. Therefore, maintaining facial neutrality in the treatment of religious groups is essential to safeguarding the constitutionally protected right to religious freedom.","Prisons must maintain facial neutrality in their treatment of religious groups in order to uphold the right to religious freedom as guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause. By avoiding subtle departures from neutrality or covert suppression of particular religious beliefs, prisons ensure that individuals can freely practice their religion without unnecessary interference. Even though the requirement does not entail identical facilities or personnel for every religious group, neutrality must be maintained unless there is a legitimate penological interest that justifies its absence. This is necessary to protect the rights of prisoners to practice their religion without discrimination or undue burden."
"Woolston, 453 N.E.2d at 968. It is for the trial court to determine whether the juror is biased for or against the defendant. Id. Only if the defendant was placed in substantial peril will we find an abuse of discretion. Id. A. Juror Jester Alvies contends that Jester should have been removed and replaced with an alternate juror because her father-in-law is a second cousin of one of the victims. In response, the State directs us to subsection (a)(4) of the statute concerning relatives within the fifth degree of the defendant or victim. We agree with the State that Alvies cannot establish that Jester is related to the victim within the fifth degree and, thus, is not entitled to have her removed for cause under that section. See Whicker v. State, 511 N.E.2d 1062, 1064-65 (Ind.1987) (<HOLDING>). As Alvies points out, however, the basis of",Should Juror Jester Alvies have been removed and replaced with an alternate juror because of her familial relationship with one of the victims?,"The question relates to the removal of a juror for cause due to a familial relationship with one of the victims.

However, the State argues that Alvies cannot establish that Jester is related to the victim within the fifth degree. The case of Whicker v. State supports this reasoning. Therefore, unless the defendant was placed in substantial peril, the trial court has the discretion to determine whether a juror is biased for or against the defendant.

The second factor, stated in subpart (C)(2),","As a legal professional, can you explain the factors that would determine whether the Corporation in question was on notice of the action against the Defendant, and how this would impact the joinder and defense in the case?","The issue at hand pertains to the notice factor in the context of joinder and defense. According to Rule 1-015(C)(1), the first factor to consider is whether the Corporation had prior notice of the action against the Defendant, specifically in relation to the Bernalillo County action. This raises the question of whether Defendant, as the principal professional in the professional corporation ""G.P. McRostie, D.O.M., N.D., P.A.,"" had informed the Corporation about the commencement of the Bernalillo County action. Additionally, it is essential to determine if the Corporation, based on Defendant's position, had received adequate notice to avoid prejudice in maintaining a defense on the merits of the claim. This analysis requires an examination of factual details, including Defendant's role within the Corporation and whether the Corporation had sufficient knowledge of the Bernalillo County action. Rivera v. King provides a precedent indicating the significance of such notice in a similar context.",The determination of whether the Corporation in question had notice of the action against the Defendant involves assessing factors such as the role of the Defendant as the principal professional in the Corporation and whether the Corporation received notice of the Bernalillo County action. This assessment is crucial as it impacts the joinder and enables the Corporation to effectively maintain a defense on the merits of the Plaintiff's claim. Rivera v. King serves as a supporting precedent in this regard.

The Reynolds case established that if a witness is absent because of the accused's actions in concealing or keeping the witness away, the accused cannot complain if competent evidence, such as the witness's previous testimony, is admitted to fill the void. The court relied on the idea that the accused's right to confrontation with witnesses is not violated if the witness's absence is a result of their own wrongful actions. However, it is important to note that the Reynolds case was overruled by Malloy v. Hogan, which held that the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination extends to state criminal proceedings. Additionally, the Illinois v.

Without an opportunity to appeal to a true New Jersey state court it is likely that the Plaintiff will not be afforded an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional challenges. See Amanatullah v. Colorado Bd. of Medical Examiners, 187 F.3d 1160, 1164 (10th Cir.1999) (<HOLDING>); Port Auth. Police Benevolent Ass’n, 973 F.2d",Is there an opportunity for the Plaintiff to raise constitutional challenges in the proceedings before the ISP Resentencing Panel?,"The question revolves around the Plaintiff's ability to raise constitutional challenges in the proceedings before the ISP Resentencing Panel. It is crucial to determine whether there is an adequate opportunity for the Plaintiff to do so. The absence of an opportunity for the Plaintiff to appeal the decisions of the ISP Panel to any New Jersey court poses a significant concern. Without the ability to present constitutional arguments to a New Jersey state court, it is likely that the Plaintiff will be deprived of an adequate opportunity to raise his constitutional challenges. The Amanatullah v. Colorado Bd. of Medical Examiners case supports the notion that without the availability of appeal to a true state court, the Plaintiff's ability to address constitutional concerns may be compromised.","No, there seems to be no opportunity for the Plaintiff to raise constitutional challenges in the proceedings before the ISP Resentencing Panel as there is no avenue for the Plaintiff to appeal the Panel's decisions to a New Jersey court and present constitutional arguments, which may result in the Plaintiff being deprived of an adequate opportunity to raise such challenges.

"CURIAM. Defendant Phillip Davis pleaded guilty to two counts of distributing controlled substances in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841, and the district court sentenced him to 120 months of imprisonment. The sole issue on appeal is whether the district court erred in designating Davis as a “career offender” pursuant to U.S. Sentencing Guidelines § 4B1.1 in light of Johnson v. United States, — U.S. —, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 (2015) (invalidating as unconstitutionally vague the “residual clause” of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. § 924(e)).

Following the reasoning of the recent decision in United States v.

"goal in construing statute is to fulfill intent of legislature). ¶ 132 Before 1985, § 40-254(A) provided that a party dissatisfied with a Commission decision could commence an action “to vacate and set aside” the decision. A.R.S. § 40-254, Historical and Statutory Notes. Section 40-254(C) was the same as it reads today. Thus, before 1985, the superior court indisputably lacked authority to grant any relief under the statute other than affirming, modifying or setting aside a Commission decision.

Prior to 1985, the statute explicitly stated that a party dissatisfied with a Commission decision could commence an action to ""vacate and set aside"" the decision. The superior court's authority was limited to affirming, modifying, or setting aside the Commission decision. Case law such as Sun City Water Co. v. Arizona Corp. Comm'n and Arizona Corp. Comm'n v. Fred Harvey Transp. Co. supported this understanding. However, in 1985, the legislature made an amendment to section 40-254(A) that is not mentioned in the provided context, thereby potentially expanding the authority of the superior court. Without knowledge of the exact nature of the amendment, it is uncertain whether the superior court's authority was affected.","Without knowledge of the specific amendment made to section 40-254(A) in 1985, it remains unclear whether the superior court now has the authority to grant relief other than affirming, modifying, or setting aside a Commission decision."
"explicit requirements — the “necessity ... of private enforcement” of the public interest.

The determination of what constitutes a reasonable time will depend on the specific context of the case. Furthermore, the court has made it clear that the awarding of attorney fees should not incentivize opportunistic lawsuits that do not genuinely serve the public good. Therefore, attorney fees for litigation can be awarded when the plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to resolve the issue outside of court, notifying the defendant and providing them with a reasonable opportunity to address the matter.","Attorney fees can be awarded for litigation when the plaintiff has made reasonable efforts to resolve the issue outside of court, notifying the defendant of grievances and proposed remedies, and providing the defendant with a reasonable opportunity to address the concerns, while ensuring that the lawsuit is genuinely in the public interest and not merely opportunistic."

Similarly, in Colorado Flying Academy, Inc. v. United States, it was held that the determination of safety requirements also requires a tailoring of safety requirements to local conditions. These precedents indicate that the determination of safety requirements indeed falls within the discretionary function exception. However, Airlog may argue against this by providing specific legal arguments or interpretations that challenge the applicability of these precedents.","Yes, Airlog can argue that the determination of safety requirements in deciding what tests were necessary to meet reasonable safety requirements does not fall within the discretionary function exception.

A remand in order to obtain another is superfluous. ¶ 31. Additionally, the majority suggests that to enforce a partition here would subvert longstanding public policy encouraging marriage. I do not find that the public policy arguments in favor of marriage impact on whether a spouse may seek the partition by sale of a financially burdensome marital home.

"161 L.Ed.2d 181 (2005). While other portions of § 1591 have been challenged on vagueness grounds, the question of § 1591(d)’s facial validity has not been considered by federal courts. See United States v. Clinton, CR 12-40018-01-KES, 2012 WL 5195987 (D.S.D. Oct. 19, 2012). Defendant contends that he could not know what actions could expose him to criminal liability under the statute. It is true that § 1591 lacks the heightened “corruptly” mens rea of 18 U.S.C. § 1503, the general obstruction of justice statute, and that “criminal offenses requiring no mens rea have a ‘generally disfavored status.’” Liparota v.

The absence of a specific mental state requirement for criminal offenses is generally disfavored by courts. This principle was established in the case of Liparota v. United States, where it was stated that offenses lacking a mens rea requirement are generally disfavored. Additionally, the case of Pettibone v. United States reinforces this notion. However, it is worth noting that while other sections of § 1591 have faced vagueness challenges, the facial validity of § 1591(d) specifically has not been addressed by federal courts. Therefore, the defendant's argument that they could not have known what actions would expose them to criminal liability under the statute may not have been considered in previous case law.","Yes, the defendant can argue that they could not know what actions could expose them to criminal liability under the statute, although it should be noted that the facial validity of § 1591(d) has not been considered by federal courts."

Clary clarified that a law's disparate impact alone is insufficient to prove discriminatory intent.

OSRAM primarily relies on two statements made by Citizen, wherein they discuss the language and the evidence of infringement. These statements are crucial in determining the existence of infringement. However, it is important to note that the lawsuit filed by OSRAM in Germany against Citizen is not relevant because it was filed after January 18, 2005, and the reasonable apprehension of infringement must exist at the time the suit was filed. Therefore, the admissibility of the statements made by Citizen becomes significant in establishing the claim of infringement against them.","OSRAM may be able to rely on the statements provided by Citizen to establish infringement and support their claim, as long as the statements are admissible and supported by the evidence available at the time the suit was filed, excluding any cases filed after January 18, 2005."

This includes projects under service contracts, national defense-related projects, and projects connected with war activities. Courts, such as the Second Circuit in Univ. of Rochester v. Hartman, have recognized that public work generally refers to government-related construction projects, those related to national defense, or employment under service contracts supporting these activities. Therefore, a housing project funded by the United States government can indeed be classified as a public work.","Yes, a housing project funded by the United States government can be considered as a public work, as per the definition provided in 42 U.S.C. § 1651(b)(1) and supported by case law such as Univ. of Rochester v.

State, 442 S.W.2d 354, 357 (Tex.Crim.App.1969) (approving instruction). When the State relies upon testimony that is required by statute to be corroborated, it is error for the trial court not to instruct the jury that the defendant cannot be convicted on such testimony unless there is other evidence tending to connect the defendant with the offense and that evidence showing only the commission of the offense is insufficient. See, e.g., Herron v. State, 86 S.W.3d 621, 631 (Tex.Crim.App.2002) (<HOLDING>); Saunders, 817 S.W.2d at 690 (same);",Why is it important to view testimony from informants or individuals with incentives to lie with caution in criminal cases?,"In criminal cases, testimony from informants or individuals with incentives to lie should be viewed with caution. This is because there are motivations for these individuals to lie in order to avoid punishment or shift blame to someone else. The policy of viewing such testimony with caution is supported by various legal cases, such as Blake v. State, Cantelon, and Burton v. State. It is crucial for the trial court to instruct the jury that if the State relies on corroborated testimony that is required by statute, the defendant cannot be convicted based solely on that testimony. The jury must be informed that there needs to be other evidence connecting the defendant with the offense, as evidence showing only the commission of the offense is insufficient. This approach ensures fairness and guards against the potential manipulation of the legal system.","It is important to view testimony from informants or individuals with incentives to lie with caution in criminal cases because these individuals may have motivations to lie in order to avoid punishment or shift blame. The legal system recognizes this and has established the requirement for corroboration in such cases. Without corroboration and additional evidence connecting the defendant with the offense, conviction based solely on testimony from informants or incentivized individuals is deemed insufficient.

"pursuing an alibi defense. The Court finds Respondent’s arguments to be without merit. The Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), qualifies as “clearly established federal law” under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). See Williams, 529 U.S. at 391, 120 S.Ct. 1495. Thus, if Petitioner can show that the Michigan courts adjudicated his failure to investigate claim in a manner contrary to Strickland, he is entitled to habeas relief. To be successful on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Strickland requires that two elements be proven. First, a petitioner must demonstrate that his attorney’s performance was deficient. Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052; see also Combs v. Coyle, 205 F.3d 269, 278 (6th Cir.2000) (<HOLDING>). To prove a deficiency, a petitioner must show",Under what circumstances is a petitioner entitled to habeas relief under the Strickland standard?,"The question pertains to the entitlement of habeas relief based on the Strickland standard. The Supreme Court's decision in Strickland v. Washington is considered ""clearly established federal law"" and qualifies as a basis for granting habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d). To establish an ineffective assistance of counsel claim under Strickland, two elements must be proven. Firstly, the petitioner must demonstrate that their attorney's performance was deficient. This means showing that the attorney's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness. Secondly, the petitioner must prove that the deficient performance prejudiced their defense, meaning that there is a reasonable probability that, but for the attorney's errors, the outcome of the trial would have been different. Applying this standard, if a petitioner can show that the state courts adjudicated their failure to investigate claim in a manner contrary to Strickland, they are entitled to habeas relief.","A petitioner is entitled to habeas relief under the Strickland standard if they can demonstrate that their attorney's performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced their defense, and if the state courts adjudicated their failure to investigate claim in a manner contrary to the Strickland standard."

In the case Jones v. Professional Hospitality Resources, Inc., the Virginia Circuit Court for the City of Virginia Beach ruled that no Virginia court has extended the tort of wrongful discharge to include scenarios of constructive discharge. This ruling indicates that constructive discharge is not currently recognized as a basis for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy in Virginia. The court's decision is further supported by federal cases such as Hairston v. Multi-Channel TV Cable Co., where the Fourth Circuit reached a conclusion consistent with Jones. Therefore, based on the prevailing legal precedent, constructive discharge cannot be considered a wrongful discharge in violation of public policy in Virginia.","No, according to the ruling in Jones v.

However, the Supreme Court's opinion in Long v. Sweitzer explicitly referred to the trial court's discretion under what is now TRAP rule 24.2(a)(3).

In cases where no additional evidence has been presented to the Board, the standard of review is limited to assessing whether constitutional rights have been violated, if there is an error of law, or if the necessary findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.

"that because the City had no control over Judge Travis in his judicial capacity, it had no power to authorize or ratify his conduct and thus could not be responsible for his acts. Plaintiffs contend Judge Travis was a city policy maker because the actions of municipal judges may constitute official municipal policy if the judge holds absolute sway over particular tasks. In Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, 619 F.2d 391, 404 (5th Cir.1980), the court found that under Texas law, county judges have duties such as presiding over county commissioners and preparing the county budget which can constitute official county policy making. A city may be liable for a judge’s acts if those acts are in accordance with city policy. Williams v. Butler, 863 F.2d 1398, 1402-03 (8th Cir.1988) (en banc) (<HOLDING>), cert. denied, 492 U.S. 906, 109 S.Ct. 3215,",Can the City be held responsible for the actions of Judge Travis?,"The question revolves around whether the City can be held responsible for the actions of Judge Travis.

This argument is supported by the case Familias Unidas v. Briscoe, where it was found that county judges in Texas have duties that can constitute official county policy making. Therefore, if Judge Travis' actions align with city policy, the City could be held responsible for his acts.

This principle was established in the Croak case and has been supported by subsequent cases such as Lasché I and Cody. The trial court exercises discretion in considering whether to impute income from the inheritance, as a parent cannot shield it from child support by converting it into a non-income producing asset. If there is sufficient foundation, the court may impute income to some or all of the inheritance. Cases like Connell v. Connell and Gainey v. Gainey have upheld this approach.","No, a parent cannot insulate an inheritance from consideration for child support by transforming it into a non-income producing asset.

"""above and beyond what is required by Tennessee law.” Turner, 2009 WL 426260, at *8. This statement of the Court of Criminal Appeals is only accurate in the post-waiver context. 11 . The court went on to state that ""[a]ssum-ing arguendo that [Tidwell]'s request in the case sub judice was equivocal, the interrogation following the equivocal request should have been strictly limited to a clarification of whether the defendant was in fact invoking his right to have counsel present during interrogation.” Id. at 387.

"does impose various duties upon those operating motor vehicles in this state, not every violation of article 6701d constitutes negligence as a matter of law. Caughman v. Glaze, 412 S.W.2d 357, 362 (Tex.Civ.App. — San Antonio 1967, writ refd n.r.e.). On a number of occasions, Texas courts have held that violations of particular sections found in article 6701d did not constitute negligence per se. These courts have held that, because a breach of these particular sections was conditioned upon proof that the defendant failed to act “safely,” “with safety,” or “prudently,” these sections imposed upon the complainant the burden of proving that his opponent acted reasonably. See Cudworth v. South Texas Paisano Constr. Co., 705 S.W.2d 315, 317 (Tex.App. — San Antonio 1986, writ refd n.r.e.) (<HOLDING>); Renfroe v.

This issue has been addressed by Texas courts in previous cases. In Caughman v. Glaze, the court held that not every violation of article 6701d constitutes negligence per se. Various Texas courts have further ruled that violations of specific sections within article 6701d do not automatically establish negligence. These courts have reasoned that such violations require proof that the defendant failed to act ""safely,"" ""with safety,"" or ""prudently,"" thereby imposing the burden of proving reasonableness upon the complainant. As affirmed in Cudworth v. South Texas Paisano Constr. Co. and Renfroe v.

"the insurer’s position is ‘reasonable and legitimate.’ ” Thompson v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co., 875 F.2d 1460, 1462 (10th Cir.1989) (quoting Manis v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co., 681 P.2d 760, 762 (Okla.1984)). After carefully reviewing the parties’ briefs, the record, and relevant Oklahoma authorities, we believe that no reasonable jury could have concluded that State Farm’s evaluation and settlement offers constituted bad faith under this standard. First, we note that State Farm’s initial settlement offer was within the range it assigned to Mr. Roberts’ claim. Thus, we are not presented with the situation where an insurer has offered to settle a dispute in an amount below the range assigned to the claim by the insurer’s own investigation. See Newport v. USAA, 11 P.3d 190, 196-197 (Okla.2000) (<HOLDING>). Moreover, because we have determined that","Based on the evaluation and settlement offers made by State Farm, can it be concluded that their actions constituted bad faith?","In order to determine whether State Farm's evaluation and settlement offers constituted bad faith, the court applied the standard set forth in Thompson v.

According to these authorities, an insurer's position is considered ""reasonable and legitimate"" if it falls within the range assigned to the claim by the insurer's own investigation. In this case, State Farm's initial settlement offer was within the range they assigned to Mr. Roberts' claim, indicating that their evaluation and settlement offers were within the acceptable bounds. Therefore, it can be concluded that no reasonable jury could have found State Farm's actions to be in bad faith, as their offers were reasonable and consistent with their own investigation.","No, it can be concluded that State Farm's evaluation and settlement offers did not constitute bad faith, as they fell within the range assigned to the claim by State Farm's own investigation."

"Subsection (a)(1) provides for forfeiture of “any interest” that the defendant “acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962.” 18 U.S.C. § 1963(a)(1) (emphasis added). Thus, under (a)(1) an interest is subject to forfeiture only if and to the extent that it was acquired or maintained in violation of § 1962. Forfeiture under (a)(1) is not limited to a defendant’s interest in the RICO enterprise. It also includes a defendant’s interest in the proceeds of the RICO violation. Russello v. United States, 464 U.S. 16, 21-22, 104 S.Ct. 296, 78 L.Ed.2d 17 (1983). Moreover, a “but for” test is used to determine whether the government has proven the required nexus between the interest in question and the RICO violation. United States v. Angiulo, 897 F.2d 1169, 1213 (1st Cir.1990) (<HOLDING>). In this case, the only evidence of any",What does it mean for an interest to be subject to forfeiture under subsection (a)(1) of Section 1963?,"To understand the extent of forfeiture under subsection (a)(1) of Section 1963, it is important to analyze the language used in the statute. Subsection (a)(1) states that ""any interest"" that the defendant acquired or maintained in violation of section 1962 is subject to forfeiture. This means that the interest that can be forfeited includes not only the defendant's interest in the RICO enterprise but also their interest in the proceeds of the RICO violation. The Supreme Court in Russello v. United States highlighted this broad interpretation of forfeiture under (a)(1). Furthermore, to establish the required nexus between the interest in question and the RICO violation, a ""but for"" test is used. This test determines whether the government has proven that the interest would not have been acquired or maintained if it were not for the violation of Section 1962. The United States v. Angiulo case solidifies the use of this test in determining forfeiture. Therefore, under subsection (a)(1) of Section 1963, an interest is subject to forfeiture if it was acquired or maintained in violation of Section 1962, including the defendant's interest in the proceeds of the RICO violation.","Under subsection (a)(1) of Section 1963, an interest is subject to forfeiture if it was acquired or maintained in violation of Section 1962. This includes both the defendant's interest in the RICO enterprise and their interest in the proceeds of the RICO violation. The required nexus between the interest in question and the RICO violation is established using a ""but for"" test, determining whether the interest would not have been acquired or maintained if it were not for the violation of Section 1962. The Supreme Court case Russello v. United States and the United States v. Angiulo case support this interpretation of forfeiture under subsection (a)(1)."
"procedures to obtain an untainted interview with L.B. were unsuccessful, because L.B.’s father spoke with her privately before she left for the shelter home. To determine what process is constitutionally due, we look to three somewhat flexible demands of procedural due process: First, the private interest that will be affected by the official action; second the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards; and finally, the Government’s interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens that the additional or substitute procedural requirement would entail.

Eldridge decision to determine the constitutional process due. The court considers three factors: the private interest that will be affected by the official action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation of such interest through the procedures used, and the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards. In this situation, the private interest at stake is the opportunity to conduct an untainted interview with the minor. The risk of an erroneous deprivation exists due to the father's private conversation with the minor. Additional or substitute procedural safeguards may be valuable to mitigate this risk. Finally, the court also considers the government's interest, including the function involved and the fiscal and administrative burdens of additional procedural requirements.","In determining the process constitutionally due in a case involving an untainted interview with a minor, the court considers the private interest affected by the action, the risk of an erroneous deprivation, and the probable value of additional or substitute procedural safeguards.

"his claims during “both the period of time before the ineffective assistance of counsel was or should have been discovered and the period from that point until the motion to reopen is filed.”). In fact, although Zheng stated that he did not learn of the ineffective assistance of his former counsel until he hired an attorney to file his motion to reopen in 2010, he failed to assert that he took any action in his proceedings during the more than seven years between his order of removal and the filing of his motion to reopen. See id. Finally, Zheng does not challenge the BIA’s determination that he failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for relief based on his practice of Falun Gong in the United States. See INS v. Abudu, 485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988) (<HOLDING>). For the foregoing reasons, the petition for",Can Zheng claim ineffective assistance of counsel during the period before he discovered or should have discovered it and the period until his motion to reopen was filed?,"The question relates to Zheng's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and the timeline for such a claim. According to the stated context, Zheng claimed that he only discovered the ineffective assistance of his former counsel when he hired an attorney to file his motion to reopen in 2010. However, Zheng did not assert that he took any action in his proceedings during the more than seven years between his order of removal and the filing of his motion to reopen. To successfully claim ineffective assistance of counsel, Zheng would need to show that he took action to address the issue once he discovered or should have discovered it. Furthermore, Zheng does not challenge the BIA's determination that he failed to establish his prima facie eligibility for relief based on his practice of Falun Gong. Therefore, based on these factors, it is unlikely that Zheng can claim ineffective assistance of counsel for the entire period before his motion to reopen was filed.","No, Zheng cannot claim ineffective assistance of counsel for the period before he discovered or should have discovered it and the period until his motion to reopen was filed, as he failed to take any action during the more than seven years between his order of removal and the filing of his motion to reopen and did not establish prima facie eligibility for relief based on his practice of Falun Gong."

"of Colo., Div. of Youth Services, 17 F.3d 1323, 1330 (10th Cir.1994). The Court will address each of these bases for liability in turn. 1. Scope of Employment Restatement § 229 provides a general definition of “scope of employment”, stating that “[t]o be within the scope of employment, conduct must be of the same general nature as that authorized, or incidental to the conduct authorized.” The comments to the Restatement provide further explanation of the meaning of “scope of employment”: “Proof that the actor was in the general employment of the 18 (10th Cir.1987) (“sexual harassment simply is not within the job description of any supervisor or any other worker in any reputable business”) (citation omitted); Sparks v.

Although the effect is to restrict",Can an employer be held liable for the actions of an employee if the employee's conduct is not within the scope of their employment?,"The question pertains to the liability of an employer for the actions of their employee. According to Restatement § 229, conduct falls within the scope of employment if it is of the same general nature as that authorized or incidental to the authorized conduct. The Tenth Circuit in Hopkins v. Price Waterhouse defined sexual harassment as conduct outside the scope of employment. Similarly, in Sparks v. Pilot Freight Carriers, the Eleventh Circuit held that an employer cannot be held liable for an employee's actions that are not within their job description. Therefore, if the employee's conduct falls outside the scope of their employment, the employer cannot be held liable for their actions.","No, an employer cannot be held liable for the actions of an employee if the employee's conduct is not within the scope of their employment, as established in the cases of Hopkins v.

Louisiana, 379 U.S. 559, 85 S.Ct. 476, 13 L.Ed.2d 487 (1965). The reach of the Texas statute, to the contrary, is far more extensive than the regulations that have been upheld, and closely resembles enactments that have been declared unconstitutionally overbroad.

Cf. Carlson v. California, 310 U.S. 106, 60 S.Ct. 746, 84 L.Ed.2d 1104 (1980) (<HOLDING>). When a legitimate state interest was not",What is the constitutionality of the Texas statute that restricts picketing?,"The question at hand pertains to the constitutionality of the Texas statute that restricts picketing. In order to determine its constitutionality, it is crucial to analyze the reach and extent of the statute compared to regulations that have been upheld by the courts. The Supreme Court has previously upheld regulations that restrict picketing under certain circumstances, such as near a school or courthouse. However, the Texas statute in question appears to be far more extensive and resembles enactments that have been declared unconstitutionally overbroad. In Coates v. City of Cincinatti, the court struck down an ordinance that criminalized assembling in a manner annoying to passing individuals. Given that the Texas statute shares similarities with other unconstitutional enactments, it is likely that it too would be deemed unconstitutional as being overbroad if challenged. This case aligns with the reasoning in Carlson v. California.","The Texas statute that restricts picketing is likely to be found unconstitutional as it appears to be overbroad and similar to enactments that have previously been struck down by the courts, such as in the case of Coates v.

These cases emphasized that summary denial of a lethal injection challenge is appropriate if the reasons presented are based on conjecture or speculation. Additionally, the court has held that the constitutionality of section 945.10, which allows for the execution of death-sentenced individuals, has already been determined and will not be revisited. Furthermore, Hall v. Moore established that presenting a claim of incompetency with regards to execution before the signing of a death warrant is premature.

Nat'l Ins. Co. On the other hand, statutes of limitations define the time within which legal action must be initiated after the occurrence of an event or discovery of a harm. Unlike statutes of repose, statutes of limitations allow for the tolling or extension of time under certain circumstances. Therefore, while statutes of limitations specify a limited timeframe for bringing claims, statutes of repose serve as an ultimate deadline beyond which claims cannot be initiated.","Statutes of repose serve to establish an absolute bar for filing claims beyond a specified time limit, creating a self-executing, absolute immunity to claims.

Further, although Chateaugay addressed the",Is the order denying the motion to withdraw the reference subject to review on appeal?,"The question relates to the reviewability of an order denying a motion to withdraw the reference. In the case Liberty Synergistics Inc. v. Microflo Ltd., the court quoted Will v. Hallock which established that certain orders that are ""effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment"" are subject to the collateral order exception. However, in this case, the collateral order exception does not apply to orders denying a motion to withdraw the reference. This was reasoned in the case In re Chateaugay Corp., which stated that such orders do not conclusively determine any substantive issue, but rather address where the issue will initially be decided. Therefore, orders denying withdrawal of reference remain subject to review on appeal. Additionally, Mahia's right to a jury trial does not change this conclusion, as established in the case Germain v. Conn.

The evidence presented includes testimony from McCloud stating that Chisolm and Bolware purchased approximately one-half kilogram of cocaine to split, purchased cocaine powder on numerous occasions, and sold crack cocaine ""cookies"" on approximately 20 occasions.

"some apparently directive or dispositive words,” such as, “ ‘the plaintiffs motion [for summary judgment] is granted.’ ” Because the opinions or memo-randa sometimes lacked all the requisite elements of a judgment, and because judges sometimes later signed formal judgments in addition to those opinions and memoranda, Rule 58 was amended to clarify when a judgment became “effective, starting the time running for post-verdict motions and for the purpose of appeal.” Given this clear need for certainty, we should not cloud the issue of when a federal court judgment is “rendered” — it is “rendered” when it is set forth in writing on a separate document and entered on the civil docket, in compliance with Rule 58. See United States v. Woods, 885 F.2d 352, 353 (6th Cir.1989) (per curiam) (<HOLDING>) (emphasis added); Simon v. City of Clute, 825","What is the significance of a judgment being ""rendered"" in a federal court and how is it determined?","The question pertains to the determination of when a federal court judgment is considered ""rendered."" Rule 58 was amended to provide clarity on when a judgment becomes effective, which is crucial for post-verdict motions and the initiation of an appeal. According to the rule, a judgment is considered ""rendered"" when it is written on a separate document and entered on the civil docket. This requirement ensures certainty and avoids confusion regarding the timing of a judgment. United States v. Woods further emphasizes that compliance with Rule 58, by setting forth the judgment in writing and entering it on the civil docket, is necessary for a judgment to be considered ""rendered.""","The significance of a judgment being ""rendered"" in a federal court is that it marks the point at which the judgment becomes effective for post-verdict motions and appeals. A judgment is deemed ""rendered"" when it is set forth in writing on a separate document and entered on the civil docket, in accordance with Rule 58. Failure to comply with this requirement may result in ambiguity and uncertainty regarding the timing of the judgment. The United States v.

"So the statute and all the Guideline references, including the Policy Statement of the Sentencing Commission, are consistent with our construction of the statute, which is that the authority of a district court to depart from the Guidelines following a motion by the government under § 3553(e), acknowledging substantial assistance, is not limited so that a finite sentence must be imposed, rather probation is authorized. Id. at 859-60. Thus, under Wilson, there was no limit on how low the district court in this case could have departed under § 3553(e) as long as the extent of the departure was reasonable under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e). This reading of Wilson is con sistent with decisional law from one of our sister circuits. Cf. United States v. Auld, 321 F.3d 861, 867 (9th Cir.2002) (<HOLDING>). It has been suggested, and interpreted by","Can a district court impose probation instead of a finite sentence when the government files a motion for departure under § 3553(e), based on substantial assistance?","The question pertains to the authority of a district court to depart from the Guidelines and the available sentencing options when the government files a motion under § 3553(e) for substantial assistance. As per the construction of the statute and the Policy Statement of the Sentencing Commission, the district court's authority to depart from the Guidelines is not limited to imposing a finite sentence. Instead, probation is authorized as well. A decision in Wilson v. United States supports this interpretation and establishes that there is no specific limit on the extent of departure as long as it is reasonable under 18 U.S.C. § 3742(e). This interpretation is also consistent with the decisional law of a sister circuit, as seen in United States v. Auld.","Yes, a district court can impose probation instead of a finite sentence when the government files a motion for departure under § 3553(e), based on substantial assistance.

After briefing on Defendants’ motion, the Court allowed Plaintiffs to file an amended complaint which included an offer of tender. Thus, Defendants' argument on that point is moot. 25 . The applicable statute of limitations in this case is governed by § 13 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77m. As discussed in detail infra, § 13 has both a 1-year and 3-year limitations period. Truly, the 3-year period is a statute of repose, not of limitations. P. Stolz Family Partnership L.P. v. Daum, 355 F.3d 92, 99-107 (2d Cir.2004); Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v.

Because the parties have referred to § 13 in",What is the applicable statute of limitations in this case and what are the different periods under this statute?,"The issue in this case pertains to the statute of limitations. According to § 13 of the Securities Act, there are two periods of limitations: a 1-year period and a 3-year period. It is important to note that the 3-year period is actually a statute of repose, rather than a statute of limitations. The distinction is crucial because a statute of repose offers an absolute time limit beyond which no action can be brought, even if the injury or violation is discovered after the set time period. This interpretation has been established in cases such as P. Stolz Family Partnership L.P. v. Daum and Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. First RepublicBank Corp. Therefore, in this case, the statute of limitations is governed by § 13 of the Securities Act, with a 1-year period and a 3-year period, which functions as a statute of repose.","The applicable statute of limitations in this case is § 13 of the Securities Act.

"breadth of the consent decree as follows: [By THE COURT:] Well, I've reviewed the matter and the case started out as a residence case, and I know that the consent decree has some additional broad language in it. But it started out as a residence case. And now under the mantle, let us say, of a contempt proceeding, it has shifted ground, and it's becoming a testing and selection case. App. I at 5. Even if the case did initially center on the residency requirement, the proper focus must be on the language contained within the consent decree itself. A judicially approved consent decree, like a settlement agreement, is essentially a contract for purposes of construction. Local No. 93, Int'l Ass'n of Firefighters v.

When examining a consent decree, the focus should be on the language contained within the decree itself, rather than the initial subject matter of the case. A consent decree, like a settlement agreement, is considered a contract and is subject to construction based on its terms. Therefore, if the consent decree includes broad language that allows for a shift in focus from a residence case to a testing and selection case, then the scope can indeed expand beyond the initial subject matter.","Yes, the scope of a consent decree can shift from a residence case to a testing and selection case if the language within the decree allows for such expansion and the court approves it."

But an assertion of one’s constitutional rights should not be the basis for an otherwise unjustified detention. See Florida v.

"any modification of the consent decree should be barred pursuant to the “continuous violation” doctrine. Under that doctrine, a defendant to a contempt proceeding may not challenge the validity of the underlying injunction as a defense to violating that injunction. Walker v. City of Birmingham, 388 U.S. 307, 318-19, 87 S.Ct. 1824, 18 L.Ed.2d 1210 (1967). Or, more simply, parties have a duty to comply with an ongoing injunction until it is dissolved. To illustrate, if the plaintiff had brought a contempt action against the defendants, focusing on retrospective, instead of pro- spective, relief, the “continuous violation” doctrine would have defeated any defense that focused solely on the validity of the underlying injunction. See, e.g., Kindred v. Duckworth, 9 F.3d 638, (7th Cir.1993) (<HOLDING>). But the plaintiff has not brought a contempt","Can the defendants challenge the validity of the consent decree as a defense to violating it based on the ""continuous violation"" doctrine?","The question involves the application of the ""continuous violation"" doctrine in challenging the validity of a consent decree. According to the doctrine established in Walker v. City of Birmingham, a defendant cannot use the validity of the underlying injunction as a defense for violating it in a contempt proceeding. This means that parties have an ongoing duty to comply with an injunction until it is dissolved. In the case at hand, if the plaintiff had initiated a contempt action against the defendants seeking retrospective relief, the ""continuous violation"" doctrine would prevent the defendants from using the validity of the consent decree as a defense. However, since the plaintiff has not brought a contempt action, the application of the doctrine in challenging the validity of the consent decree may not be applicable.","The defendants may not be able to challenge the validity of the consent decree as a defense to violating it based on the ""continuous violation"" doctrine.

"A Defendant’s first contention is that a reasonable jury could have found that he negligently caused Russell’s death while acting in self-defense. He argues that an involuntary manslaughter instruction was warranted because he attempted to use nondeadly force, but did so in a criminally negligent manner and death resulted. See United States v. Begay, 833 F.2d 900, 901 (10th Cir.1987). As discussed in the preceding section, a rational jury could have believed Arvin’s actions were in self-defense.

Manuel, 706 F.2d 908, 915 (9th Cir.1983)); see also United States v. Browner, 889 F.2d 549, 555 (5th Cir.1989) (<HOLDING>); United States v.

Begay establishes that a charge of involuntary manslaughter may be applicable in such circumstances where nondeadly force was used but resulted in death due to criminal negligence. In this case, the court acknowledges that involuntary manslaughter can occur even in situations that would otherwise support a self-defense claim. Therefore, a reasonable jury could potentially accept the Defendant's argument.","Yes, the Defendant can make the argument that he caused Russell's death while acting in self-defense, but negligently, which may give rise to a charge of involuntary manslaughter, as supported by the United States v.

The officers obtained a search warrant on March 5 to search Grenning’s residence for his computer. On March 6 the officers entered Gren-ning’s residence and seized his computer. The officers conducted continuing forensic examinations of the computer for more than ten days after the date the search warrant had been issued. The court noted that, because computer searches usually occur at different locations than where the computer is seized and involve more preparation and expertise than an ordinary search, delays in the forensic examination of computers are expected and reasonable.

Kaupp, 453 Mass. 102, 899",Can the officers continue forensic examinations of a computer beyond ten days after obtaining a search warrant?,"The question pertains to the constitutionality of forensic searches of computers that extend beyond ten days. In the case of 174 P.3d 706 (2008), the Washington Court of Appeals addressed this issue. The court acknowledged that computer searches typically require more time, preparation, and expertise compared to ordinary searches, as they often take place at different locations from where the computer was seized. The court found that delays in the forensic examination of computers are expected and reasonable. Therefore, in this case, the officers were justified in continuing their forensic examinations of Grenning's computer for more than ten days after the search warrant was issued.","Yes, the officers can continue forensic examinations of a computer beyond ten days after obtaining a search warrant, as established by the Washington Court of Appeals in the case of 174 P.3d 706 (2008)."

The applicable Coverage Plan insured the members of the board of trustees of the school district. The company defended the trustees in a lawsuit that was brought against the school district and the trustees. When the trustees were dismissed from the suit leaving only the school district as a defendant, the company withdrew the defense and the school district sued for a declaratory judgment. The court held that the insurance policy unambiguously only insured the trustees. Id. at 612. See also St. Paul Guardian Insurance Co., 548 So.2d at 1160 (<HOLDING>). The court was not persuaded by the argument",Does the insurance policy cover the school district in the lawsuit if the trustees have been dismissed from the suit?,"The question revolves around the interpretation of the insurance policy issued by the company. The policy clearly states that the company will pay on behalf of the school district for any indemnity it is required or permitted to pay to insured persons under the applicable Coverage Plan. However, the applicable Coverage Plan specifically insures the members of the board of trustees of the school district. In a similar case, the court held that the insurance policy unambiguously only covered the trustees. Therefore, based on the language of the policy and the previous court decision, it can be reasoned that once the trustees have been dismissed from the lawsuit, the insurance policy no longer covers the school district.","No, the insurance policy does not cover the school district in the lawsuit once the trustees have been dismissed from the suit, as determined by the court's interpretation of the policy language and a previous court decision."

Under Louisiana law, different terms in a statute or policy should not be assumed to be synonymous. In this case, the phrase ""benefits accrued"" indicates that there is a distinction between when the benefits are earned and when the expenses are incurred. The Colwell v. State and Spragio v.

In other words, the terms of the Purchase Agreement provided either the same period or a longer period of time within which Venezia had the opportunity and ability to cancel the Agreement without cause, which again obviates his cause of action based on the failure of the Purchase Agreement to include language that precisely mirrored the language set forth in the statute.

According to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the developer is obligated to furnish the Condominium Documents to Venezia after the execution of the agreement. This indicates that Venezia would have access to these documents at some point, even if it is not specified when. The Purchase Agreement grants Venezia the same or a longer period of time to cancel the agreement without cause, which negates his cause of action based on the absence of specific language in the agreement regarding the non-receipt of the Condominium Documents.

"whether a suspect would submit to a blood-alcohol test was not interrogation within the meaning of Miranda.

Ed. 2d 748, 759 n.15, 103 S. Ct. 916, 923 n.15.

According to the Texas Family Code, for a child's statement to be admissible, the child must have received a warning from a magistrate explaining their right to remain silent and not make any statement that could be used against them. In the case of Sosa v. State, the Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that as long as the warning given to an adult defendant conveys the exact meaning of the statutory language, even if it differs slightly, it is considered compliant with the law. However, numerous subsequent criminal cases have not been published to determine if this reasoning applies to children as well.

"we hesitate to affirm the adverse credibility finding solely on the basis of these differences in the affidavits. Finally, the BIA and IJ erred by relying on Kumar’s failure to present evidence to corroborate his attendance at Sikh religious facilities. The IJ did not give Ku-mar a reasonable opportunity to explain the absence of corroborating evidence. For example, when the IJ asked Kumar why he had not produced a witness to confirm that he attended Sikh facilities in San Jose and Fremont, Kumar responded “I haven’t brought it, but I can bring it.” Thereafter, the IJ never asked Kumar to make good on that offer yet then relied on the absence of any such witness to find that Kumar lacked credibility.

Moreover, consent is an exception to the requirements of both the Iowa and Federal Constitutions, and it would be inconsistent with our judicial role under the circumstances to eschew our state constitution and interpret the issue under the Federal Constitution unless 2d 339, 341 (1998) (<HOLDING>).

The court has previously held that under the Iowa Constitution, probationers do not need to provide voluntary consent for such searches.

Unlike the current case, if § 204b’s seventy-percent rule had been applied to plaintiff, the statute’s plain terms would have retroactively increased the length of plaintiffs minimum sentence.

This means that retroactively increasing a prisoner's sentence based on a change in the law would be unconstitutional. In the current case, the comparison to the application of § 204b's seventy-percent rule to the plaintiff demonstrates that retroactively increasing the sentence would violate the Ex Post Facto Clause.

Continuous human surveillance for a week would require all the time and expense of several police officers, while comparable photographic surveillance would require a net of video cameras so dense and so widespread as to catch a person’s every movement, plus the manpower to piece the photographs together. Of course, as this case and some of the GPS cases in other courts illustrate, e.g., Weaver, 12 N.Y.3d at 447, 459, 882 N.Y.S.2d 357, 909 N.E.2d 1195 (<HOLDING>); Jackson, 76 P.3d at 223 (holding use of GPS",Can visual surveillance be considered a viable alternative to GPS surveillance in terms of time and cost?,"The question pertains to the comparison between visual surveillance and GPS surveillance in terms of practical considerations such as time and cost.

Similarly, photographic surveillance would require a dense network of video cameras and manpower to piece together the photographs.

While the Supreme Court has expressed",Are the Individual Defendants entitled to the protection of tribal immunity because they were employees of SCTC and not tribal officials?,"The question revolves around the issue of tribal immunity. Indian tribes possess sovereignty over their members and territories and are considered ""domestic dependent nations."" This grants them certain immunities and protections from legal actions. In determining whether SCTC and the Individual Defendants are entitled to tribal immunity in this case, the court needs to consider two factors. Firstly, whether SCTC, as an Indian tribe, is entitled to tribal immunity. And secondly, whether the Individual Defendants, who were employees of SCTC and not tribal officials, can also claim the protection of tribal immunity. The court should refer to relevant legal precedents, such as the Ramey Construction Co. v.

Essential function means the fundamental duties of the position. 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(n)(l). Attendance can be an essential job function. See Brenneman v. MedCentral Health System, 366 F.3d 412 (6th Cir.2004) (<HOLDING>); Gantt v. Wilson Sporting Goods Co., 143 F.3d",Can JC Penney argue that accommodating Bukta's part-time schedule would impose an undue hardship on their business?,"The question concerns whether JC Penney can claim that accommodating Bukta's part-time schedule would cause an undue hardship on their business.

The ADA defines undue hardship as significant difficulty or expense when considering factors such as the nature and cost of the accommodation, the overall financial resources of the employer, the number of employees, and the type of operation. JC Penney can argue that Bukta's requested part-time schedule eliminates the essential job requirement of attendance, which could be seen as an undue hardship on their business. The case law supports JC Penney's argument, as seen in Brenneman v. MedCentral Health System, where it was held that attendance can be an essential job function.","Yes, JC Penney can argue that accommodating Bukta's part-time schedule would impose an undue hardship on their business under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

In United States v. Bradshaw, the court relied on the reasoning in Patterson to conclude that a defendant raising an affirmative defense during sentencing does not violate due process, even if the burden of proof is shifted to the defendant. The court emphasized that the sentencing process is no more exacting than establishing guilt. Therefore, the burden of proof assignment in § 3559(c)(3)(A) that requires the defendant to prove an affirmative defense does not violate due process rights. United States v.

"mental institutions, like prisoners, are deprived of unrestricted association with friends, family, and community; they must contend with locks, guards, and detailed regulation of their daily activities. In addition, a person who has been hospitalized involuntarily may to a significant extent lose the right enjoyed by others to withhold consent to medical treatment. . . . We should not presume that he lacks a compelling interest in having the decisions to commit him and to keep him institutionalized made carefully, and in a manner that preserves the maximum degree of personal autonomy.

In the case of Jones v. United States, the Supreme Court recognized that individuals in mental institutions, much like prisoners, experience restrictions on their association and daily activities. They may also lose the right to withhold consent to medical treatment. The court emphasized the importance of making careful decisions regarding the commitment and institutionalization of such individuals, acknowledging their compelling interest in preserving their personal autonomy. Similarly, in Rachel v. State, the court acknowledged the importance of personal autonomy for individuals in mental institutions, citing Foucha v. Louisiana, which emphasized the need for careful decision-making. In Lessard v. Schmidt, a three-judge district court held that individuals in mental institutions have the right to receive fair and individualized treatment, protecting their personal autonomy. Considering these precedents, it can be concluded that individuals in mental institutions have the right to personal autonomy and should have their medical treatment decisions made carefully while preserving their maximum degree of personal autonomy.","Individuals in mental institutions have the right to personal autonomy, as recognized by the Supreme Court in cases like Jones v. United States and Foucha v. Louisiana.

The agent responded, “I could see him as plainly as I can see him sitting there, actually probably a little bit closer.” This evidence was sufficient to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the person who had committed the crimes in question was indeed Robert Castaneda.

Because we conclude that the evidence presented prior to the initial close of the prosecution’s case was sufficiently strong to identify Castaneda, we need not reach Castaneda’s second contention. The explicit identification presented after the reopening did not affect the outcome of the case, and therefore even if we were to assume that the court erred in allowing the prosecution to reopen its case, any such error was harmless.

In Vizcarra-Ayala v. Mukasey, the court concluded that Section 475(c) is not categorically a forgery offense. This means that Ramirez's crime does not meet the requirements of the generic definition of forgery and cannot be considered an aggravated felony under the categorical approach. However, if a state statute is categorically broader than the generic definition, the modified categorical approach can be applied. But in this case, California Penal Code § 475(c) is missing an essential element of the generic forgery offense, which means we cannot use the modified categorical approach.

"loss suffered by Huffy was the direct result of the tumultuous economic environment during the class period and non-fraudulent bad news that was occurring simultaneously. Although that argument, supported by proper evidence, may demonstrate that Defendants are entitled to summary judgment on this issue, should this lawsuit proceed to that stage, it does not cause this Court to conclude that the Plaintiffs have failed to plead the element of loss causation. On the contrary, they have set forth their theory of loss causation in detail, and that theory is based on more than the bare assertion that the Defendants’ alleged misrepresentations merely caused the value of Huffy’s stock to become inflated.

The Plaintiffs have provided a detailed theory of loss causation that is more than a mere assertion of the Defendants' alleged misrepresentations causing an inflation in the stock value of Huffy.

Most of the claims were settled in a similar manner, at least until the scheme began to unravel. The use of an objective “probable loss” analysis is particularly appropriate in a case such as the one before us. Each substantive count was tied to a different accident and a corresponding attempt to defraud. Many of these discrete facets of the ongoing scheme had flowered into fully realized crimes for which the actual loss, i.e., the settlement with the insurance company, provides conclusive evidence of the probable loss. See United States v. Bailey, 975 F.2d 1028 (4th Cir.1992) (<HOLDING>). We find no clear error in the court’s","Can the use of an objective ""probable loss"" analysis be justified in this case?","The question relates to the use of an objective ""probable loss"" analysis in the context of a fraud case. The court in United States v. Bailey established that in cases involving attempts to defraud through multiple accidents and insurance claims, an objective ""probable loss"" analysis can be justified. This analysis takes into account the settlement with the insurance company as conclusive evidence of the probable loss. By tying each substantive count to a different accident and corresponding attempt to defraud, the court can consider the actual loss as evidence of the probable loss.

"whom the estoppel is sought, and consequently changed its position to its prejudice. Id.” 758 So.2d at 555. Joe Jr. argues that the holding in Jin-right is limited to the situation in which a petitioner in bankruptcy omits a potential claim in his schedule of assets and then later sues on that claim. We do not read Jinright so narrowly, however, and we can find no indication that our supreme court, in outlining the elements that must be proved to establish judicial estoppel, confined its statements to the bankruptcy context. We hold that the doctrine of judicial estoppel is inapplicable here for at least two reasons. First, Robert and Joe Jr., the parties asserting the estoppel, were not parties to the Florida divorce action. Cf. Singley v. Bentley, 782 So.2d 799 (Ala.Civ.App.2000) (<HOLDING>). Second, the parties claiming the estoppel did",Can the doctrine of judicial estoppel be applied in this case even though Robert and Joe Jr. were not parties to the Florida divorce action?,"The question revolves around the applicability of the doctrine of judicial estoppel in a scenario where the parties asserting the estoppel were not involved in the original action. The court in Jinright v. Estate of Thomas held that in order to establish judicial estoppel, the party seeking the estoppel must show that the opposing party made a conflicting statement under oath, the inconsistency between the two positions is clear and unequivocal, and the party asserting the estoppel detrimentally relied on the inconsistent statement. However, the court in Jinright did not explicitly limit its statements to the bankruptcy context. Considering this, we find that the doctrine of judicial estoppel cannot be applied here for two reasons. Firstly, Robert and Joe Jr., who are claiming the estoppel, were not parties to the Florida divorce action. Secondly, the parties seeking the estoppel did not demonstrate that they detrimentally relied on any conflicting statement made by the opposing party. Therefore, the doctrine of judicial estoppel is inapplicable in this case.","No, the doctrine of judicial estoppel cannot be applied in this case as Robert and Joe Jr., who are asserting the estoppel, were not parties to the Florida divorce action.

However, as the Maryland Court of Special Appeals recognized in Maddox: [T]he imposition of a sanction that precludes a material witness from testifying, and, consequently, effectively dismisses a potentially meritorious claim without a trial, should be reserved for egregious violations of the court’s scheduling order, and should be supported by evidence of willful or contemptuous or otherwise opprobrious behavior on the part of the party or counsel. 921 A.2d at 922. See also Revco, D.S., Inc. v. Cooper, 873 S.W.2d 391, 397 (Tex.App.1994) (<HOLDING>).

The Maryland Court of Special Appeals, in the case of Maddox, determined that the imposition of sanctions that prevent a material witness from testifying and effectively dismiss a potentially meritorious claim without a trial should be reserved for egregious violations of the court's scheduling order. To support such sanctions, there must be evidence of willful, contemptuous, or otherwise opprobrious behavior on the part of the party or counsel. The court recognized that scheduling orders are valuable tools for managing a trial court's docket efficiently, but imposing severe sanctions, such as preventing a witness from testifying, should only be done in exceptional circumstances. The case of Revco, D.S., Inc. v. Cooper further supports this reasoning.","The court can impose sanctions that prevent a material witness from testifying if there is strong evidence of willful, contemptuous, or otherwise opprobrious behavior regarding the violation of a scheduling order in a trial court.

"for her obedience, they would protect her from physical and emotional injury. This count of the plaintiffs revised complaint is not barred by the statute of limitations since the alleged act of Watchtower that disfellowshipped her can be considered as the date the breach of the implied agreement occurred, which is less than six years from the date this action was instituted. The defendants also argue that the first amendment prohibits this court from considering the breach of contract claim, since, to determine this claim, the court necessarily would become involved in an “excessive entanglement” with religion. The first amendment does not bar application of a secular standard to certain tortious conduct in a chinch setting. See Mullen v. Horton, 46 Conn.

We simply do not know. Given these possibilities, the ambiguity in the case law, and the context of the present testimony, we cannot say that admission of the evidence constituted plain error. We conclude by emphasizing that, to satisfy the plain error standard, Smith must show that the alleged error “affected] substantial rights,” that is, “affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.” Olano, 507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770 (<HOLDING>).

The Whistleblower Protection Act, as outlined in 5 U.S.C.A. §§ 2301-02, offers protections to federal employees who disclose information regarding violations of laws, rules, or regulations, or gross mismanagement, waste, or abuse of authority. While some argue that the protected activity must be directly related to the job, it is important to note that the Bush case, as cited in the context, implies that even in circumstances where the protected activity is not directly related to the job, the provisions of the Whistleblower Protection Act can still apply. This interpretation is supported by cases such as Kotarski v. Cooper. Therefore, even if the Rollinses' protected activity was not directly related to their job, they may still be eligible for the remedies provided by the Whistleblower Protection Act.","Yes, the remedies provided by the Whistleblower Protection Act can be applied to the case involving the Rollinses, even if their protected activity was not directly related to their job, as established by the Bush case and supported by precedent cases such as Kotarski v.

Rather, it appears that they were the victims of a collapsing real estate market that caught them by surprise as they were attempting to move from one house to another that was more suited to their needs. In retrospect, they clearly extended themselves unwisely, but certainly they were not the only home buyers in the 2005 to 2007 time frame who did not foresee the precipitous drop in property values that took even experienced real estate professionals in Northern Virginia by surprise. In any event, poor financial decisions, standing alone, do not equate to abuse. In re Smith, 354 B.R. 787 (Bankr.W.D.Va. 2006) (<HOLDING>).

The court recognized that the victims of the collapsing real estate market in the 2005 to 2007 time frame, including the individuals in question, were not the only ones who did not anticipate the significant drop in property values. The court emphasized that the individuals' situation was not a result of consistently living beyond their means but rather an unfortunate consequence of the unexpected market conditions. Thus, the poor financial decisions should not be a barrier to their eligibility for bankruptcy.","Yes, the individuals can file for bankruptcy due to the collapse of the real estate market, even if their financial decisions were poor.

"in bankruptcy. As of November 23, 2005, the Debtor owed the Creditor approximately $114,040. A debtor cannot claim an exemption against amounts owed on a secured debt that represents a voluntary encumbrance of property; consequently, the Debtor is not entitled to any exemption in the $114,040 owed to the Creditor. Because the Debtor’s principal residence was sold for $130,000, the Debtor’s entitlement to an exemption based on the transfer sought to be avoided was only $15,960. Assuming that all four of the requirements are met, a debtor has the right to avoid the transfer of his property to the extent that he could have exempted such property. See Compton v.

"theory of the case, any weakness or implausibility in that theory is a matter for the jury, not for the court. See Folger v. State, 648 P.2d at 113. Admittedly, there are some exceptions to this doctrine where the defense of necessity is concerned. There are several Alaska eases which conclude that trial judges did not abuse their discretion in refusing to give necessity defenses. However, we believe that a close reading of those cases establishes that the defendants in those cases had clear legal alternatives to violating the law. See Nelson v. State, 597 P.2d 977, 980 (Alaska 1979) (finding that defendant had several lawful alternatives and that “[t]he seriousness of the offenses committed by Nelson were disproportionate to the situation he faced.”); Schnabel, 663 P.2d at 966 (<HOLDING>); Cleveland, 631 P.2d at 1081 (holding","If the defense of necessity is raised, can the court refuse to consider any weakness or implausibility in the defendant's theory of the case?","The question pertains to the court's evaluation of the defense of necessity and its relation to the defendant's theory of the case. Generally, any weakness or implausibility in the defendant's theory of the case is a matter for the jury to consider, not the court. This principle is supported by the Folger v. State case. However, there are exceptions to this doctrine when it comes to the defense of necessity. In some Alaska cases, trial judges have been deemed to have not abused their discretion in rejecting necessity defenses. Nevertheless, upon closer examination of these cases, it becomes apparent that the defendants in those cases had clear legal alternatives to violating the law. The Nelson v. State case demonstrates that the defendant had lawful alternatives available, and the seriousness of the offenses committed were disproportional to the situation faced by the defendant. Schnabel and Cleveland also support this reasoning.","No, the court cannot refuse to consider any weakness or implausibility in the defendant's theory of the case when the defense of necessity is raised.

"protect its interest by “do[ing] and pay[ing] whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and the Lender’s rights in the property ....” Nothing in these terms requires the lender to purchase the cheapest insurance or the insurance that provides the most value for the borrower. Thus, Standard Mortgage did not act on Robinson’s behalf when it force-placed insurance coverage; it acted to protect its oum interest in the mortgaged property—an interest that Robinson threatened by breaching her own contractual duty to maintain insurance coverage. So although Robinson sprinkles her complaint with the “kickback” label, the commissions and portfolio monitoring that SM Insurance provided to Standard Mortgaged were “not. ,kickback[s] in any meaningful sense.” Cohen, 735 F.3d at 611 (<HOLDING>); see also Feaz, 745 F.3d at 1111 (agreeing",Can Standard Mortgage be considered as acting on behalf of the borrower when force-placing insurance coverage?,"The question revolves around whether Standard Mortgage, when force-placing insurance coverage, was acting on behalf of the borrower or solely to protect its own interest in the mortgaged property. The terms of the agreement between the borrower and Standard Mortgage do not require the lender to secure the cheapest or most valuable insurance for the borrower. Instead, it explicitly states that Standard Mortgage will do whatever is necessary to protect its own interest and the value of the property. This means that when Standard Mortgage force-placed insurance coverage, it did so in order to safeguard its own rights in the property, particularly since the borrower breached her contractual duty to maintain insurance coverage. The ""kickback"" label used by the borrower is not applicable here, as the commissions and portfolio monitoring provided by SM Insurance to Standard Mortgage were not kickbacks in any meaningful sense, as established in the Cohen and Feaz cases.","No, Standard Mortgage cannot be considered as acting on behalf of the borrower when force-placing insurance coverage.

"most like a prison, Judge Gleeson applied the Covino/Tumer standard. See id. This was correct. The Plaintiff was confined for an extended period of time in a prison-like environment, and it appears that he was charged with felonies, see 18 U.S.C. §§ 371, 1028. In the environment where the Plaintiff was held, the lesser reasonable suspicion standard would jeopardize prison officials’ ability to maintain security. As Judge Gleeson recognized, even if the precise standard governing intrusive searches of the Plaintiff at the MDC might not have been clearly established in 2001, it was clearly established that even the standard most favorable to prison officials required that strip and body-cavity searches be rationally related to legitimate government purposes.

Judge Gleeson correctly applied the Covino/Tumer standard, which is appropriate in situations where individuals are confined for an extended period of time in a prison-like environment and are charged with felonies. This standard allows prison officials to maintain security by conducting intrusive searches. Even if the specific standard governing such searches at the MDC was not clearly established in 2001, it was clearly established that these searches must be rationally related to legitimate government purposes, even under the most favorable standard to prison officials. Therefore, considering the circumstances in this case, it can be reasoned that the prison officials' decision to subject the Plaintiff to strip and body-cavity searches was legally permissible.","Yes, it was legally permissible for the prison officials to subject the Plaintiff to strip and body-cavity searches in the prison-like environment where he was held, as it was necessary for maintaining security and was rationally related to legitimate government purposes, based on the Covino/Tumer standard and the understanding that even the most favorable standard to prison officials requires a rational relation to legitimate purposes."
"a third party. As noted, there is no identifiable third party in this case. The transfers are thus properly viewed as either benefiting the Fund or benefiting Bear Stearns. In either case, reliance by Bear Stearns on the mere conduit concept is unavailing. More importantly, once the funds were deposited, and as long as short positions were open, Bear Stearns did not have to respond to directions from the Fund. Indeed, so long as there were open short positions, Bear Stearns was not required to return the money to the Fund and was also able to initiate affirmative measures with respect to the funds. Thus, Bear Stearns’s position is simply not parallel to the traditional bank cases. See Malloy v. Citizens Bank of Sapulpa (In re First Security Mortgage Co.), 33 F.3d 42, 43 (10th Cir.1994) (<HOLDING>); see also In re Chase & Sanborn, 848 F.2d at",Can Bear Stearns rely on the mere conduit concept to defend its transfers of funds in this case?,"The question revolves around whether Bear Stearns can use the mere conduit concept to justify its transfers of funds.

According to this framework, the plaintiff must first establish a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that they belong to a protected class, they were qualified for the position, they suffered an adverse employment action, and there were similarly situated employees outside of the protected class who were treated more favorably. Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden then shifts to the defendant to provide a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the adverse employment action. If the defendant meets this burden, the plaintiff then has the opportunity to show that the defendant's stated reason is merely a pretext for discrimination. This requires the plaintiff to provide evidence that the defendant's reason is false and that discrimination was the real motivating factor. In the present case, since there is no direct evidence of age discrimination, the plaintiff should proceed with the McDonnell Douglas pretext analysis to argue their disparate treatment claim.","In the absence of direct evidence of age discrimination, the plaintiff's disparate treatment claim should be analyzed using the McDonnell Douglas pretext analysis.

"statutory sodomy, and it does pot consist of an attempt to commit the latter offense. Thus, first-degree sexiial misconduct as defined by section 566.090 does not satisfy any of the subparts of section 566.046.1(2) and therefore is not a lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy. Our holding is consistent with State v. Greenlee, 327 S.W.3d 602, 621 (Mo.App. E.D. 2010), in which this Court held that first-degree sexual misconduct, as defined by section 566.090 is not a.lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy because the former requires proof of “lack of consent.” Id.

App. 1063-65 (deposition of Mrs. Muskrat in which she admits the Muskrats never told school officials that timeouts were producing severe stress symptoms in J.M.). 6 . See Doe v. Hawaii Dept. of Educ., 334 F.3d 906, 908-09 (9th Cir.2003) (<HOLDING>); Gottlieb v. Laurel Highlands Sch. Dist., 272",Can damages be awarded under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) even if the injury occurred before seeking relief through the IDEA process?,"The question pertains to the availability of damages under IDEA in cases where the injury occurred prior to seeking relief through the IDEA process. In Seligmann, A Diller A Dollar: Section 1983 Claims in Special Education Lawsuits, it is argued that measuring available relief at the time of the injury ensures that the IDEA process is not ignored, preventing further harm to the child until damages are the only remedy left. This implies that damages can indeed be awarded for injuries that occurred before seeking relief under IDEA. The case of Doe v. Hawaii Dept. of Educ. supports this reasoning.","Yes, damages can be awarded under IDEA even if the injury occurred before seeking relief through the IDEA process, as established in the Seligmann and Doe v. Hawaii Dept. of Educ. cases."
"he hesitate to answer questions at any time.” The trial court made extensive findings of fact in accord with this evidence. Defendant did not except to any of these findings. Id. The Court then held that “[f]rom these findings the trial court correctly concluded that the statement ‘was made freely, voluntarily, understanding [sic] and knowingly ....’” Id. at 20, 277 S.E.2d at 529. The Court concluded, therefore, that the trial court properly admitted the defendant’s incriminating statements. In this case, the trial court made comparable findings based on similar evidence. Under McCoy, therefore, the trial court’s findings in this case support its conclusion that defendant’s three statements were voluntary and admissible. See also State v. McKoy, 323 N.C. 1, 17, 372 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1988) (<HOLDING>), vacated on other grounds, 494 U.S. 433, 108",Did the trial court properly admit the defendant's incriminating statements as evidence?,"The question here revolves around the admissibility of the defendant's incriminating statements in court. In the case of McCoy, the court held that the trial court had correctly admitted the defendant's statements as they were made freely, voluntarily, and with understanding. The court relied on extensive findings of fact that supported this conclusion. Similarly, in this case, the trial court made comparable findings based on similar evidence, leading to the conclusion that the defendant's statements were voluntary and admissible. Therefore, the trial court's decision to admit the defendant's incriminating statements was proper.","Yes, the trial court properly admitted the defendant's incriminating statements as evidence based on the findings of fact and evidence that supported the conclusion that the statements were made voluntarily and with understanding."
"for refund with the IRS for the amount of tax at issue. See 26 U.S.C. § 7422(a) (stating that “[n]o suit or proceeding shall be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected, ..., until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed with the Secretary ... ”). Third, a plaintiff is required to provide the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded, as well as a copy of the refund claim, when filing a refund suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims. See RCFC 9(h)(6). Failure to plead that a timely refund claim has been filed, even in pro se actions, deprives the United States Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction. See Wozniak v. United States, 618 F.2d 119 (Ct.Cl.1979) (<HOLDING>). Plaintiff has not satisfied the prerequisites",Do I need to file a claim for refund with the IRS before pursuing a refund suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims?,"The question revolves around the requirement of filing a claim for a refund with the IRS before initiating a refund suit. According to 26 U.S.C. § 7422(a), no suit or proceeding can be maintained in any court for the recovery of any internal revenue tax until a claim for refund or credit has been duly filed. Additionally, when filing a refund suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, it is necessary to provide the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded, along with a copy of the refund claim, as stated in RCFC 9(h)(6). Failure to plead the timely filing of a refund claim deprives the United States Court of Federal Claims of jurisdiction, as established in the Wozniak v. United States case.","Yes, it is necessary to file a claim for refund with the IRS before pursuing a refund suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims, as mandated by 26 U.S.C. § 7422(a) and RCFC 9(h)(6). Failure to do so may result in the court lacking jurisdiction, as per the Wozniak v. United States case."
