Given the district court’s recognition of Barrientos-Maldonado’s “very serious” criminal history, his sentence of fifty-seven months, which is at the low end of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines, is not unreasonable.

But the fact that the disciplinary committee had before it the same evidence entails only that the committee faced the same fact issues that would confront a jury; it is not evidence that shows the committee was acting out an unwritten policy of allowing officers to use deadly force whenever they feel their safety is threatened.

First, Piatt’s holding is the far narrower proposition that alleging challenged conduct to be a “matter of consistent policy” is sufficient to withstand attack on Parratt grounds. 773 F.2d at 1034. As alleged, the conduct in Piatt was authorized by state policy, 773 F.2d at 1034; therefore, Parratt does not apply to the conduct, whether deliberate or not.

As a result, if a Securities Act class action is initiated in state court, that action is not barred from removal; indeed, such action must either be removéd to federal court or dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Under plain-error review, in the light of the lack of authority in this, or any other, circuit regarding whether the rebuttable presumption is limited only to cases whose facts involve actual minor victims (again, Emmons’ conduct involved undercover agents), the district court could not have plainly erred in applying the rebuttable presumption in favor of detention pursuant to § 3142(e).

We now turn to the salient question of whether the denial of Ditch’s right to counsel at his preliminary hearing was harmless error.

"two months earlier. Defense counsel’s failure to present evidence from the previous trial is much more likely to affect the outcome of the sentencing phase. Because so much time passed between the conviction and the sentencing, and this evidence was substantial enough that it reasonably could have altered the balance between the mitigating and aggravating circumstances, there does seem to be a reasonable probability that, but for defense counsel’s failure to reargue the favorable evidence from trial, the judge would have sentenced Pizzuto to life rather than death. Also, considered cumulatively with counsel’s other deficiencies discussed below, defense counsel’s failure to contest the State’s case in aggravation was prejudicial. See Harris v.

This Court could retain the state law claims only by exercising its supplemental jurisdiction. This case does not, however, present a compelling reason for this Court to decide claims that arise solely under state law. Accordingly, the Court dismisses Counts VI-V.

"visa. ‘Eligibility to receive such visa’ is unambiguous, and because the phrase is unambiguous, our inquiry must end with the statute’s plain language.” Id.

All circuits that have addressed this issue have read the plain language of 8 U.S.C. § 1154(a)(l)(I)(ii)(II) in the same way even in the wake of what may seem to be harsh results, such as when defendants failed to even process the applications of otherwise eligible diversity participants before the end of the fiscal year.

I believe that the language of this provision, which includes “thirty (30) days before the primary----” as its reference point of disaffiliation, when read in context, clearly reveals that the General Assembly intended it to apply to major, not minor, political parties. This is so because in the Election Code, the legislature has determined that only major parties may gain ballot access through the primary process. See Heicklen v.

"Having determined that the district court’s sentencing calculations were based oh a proper interpretation of § 2F1.1(b)(1), we turn to the district court’s assessment of the amount of the intended loss. We find that the district court’s determination that Kipta intended to defraud First Chicago out of the entire $171,355.46 was not clearly erroneous. The fraudulent letter that Kipta used to back her deposits stated that she had -reserves of $800,000.00, an amount more than sufficient to cover the deposits into the First Chicago account. There was nothing to limit the amount of funds available for withdrawal, and the corresponding potential for loss by First Chicago, to less than the total amount deposited into the account.

Similar to our holding in Issue I, absent a proffer of information that trial counsel could have uncovered and used to impeach the bad act witnesses’ testimony, Elliott’s claim that he was prejudiced by a deficiency in his investigation or preparation fails.

See Gilman v. Commonwealth, 275 Va. 222, 657 S.E.2d 474 (2008). However, in criminal cases, the General Assembly has not provided any authorization that would permit a circuit court to review a district court’s discretionary decision ending a prosecution.

"the court acknowledged: [I]t is extraordinary for dischargeability litigation that hinges on a debtor’s medical condition to actually hinge on medical testimony. This is because all dis-chargeability litigation involves real persons who are debtors under the Bankruptcy Code, and cannot afford to hire medical experts to testify to the effect of their disease on their disease on their earning capacity. When medical testimony is offered by the debtor it is to lay skepticism to rest, and in this writer’s experience the medical condition of any debtor has never been the subject of dueling experts in § 523(a)(8) litigation. 219 B.R. 665, 669 (Bankr.W.D.N.Y.1998).

The latter claim is the based upon the Rolands’ belief that General Motors should have warned that the lap belt was only properly used with a conventional child car seat.

Finally, Santos’s argument that the Government violated 8 C.F.R. § 287.6(a)by submitting the Form 1-213 without authentication does not provide a basis for termination because Santos was not prejudiced by the submission.

The father filed a timely postjudgment motion, which the trial court granted in part and denied in part. The father timely appealed to this court. The father first argues that the trial court erred in awarding the mother “living expense assistance.” The father contends that Alabama law does not recognize such an award, except for periodic alimony, which, he says, the mother did not request and could not recover.

As Webster sees it, the enhancement does not apply. In his view, the commentary limits the application of the charity enhancement, and he was not acting to obtain a benefit on behalf of a charitable organization (as the commentary seems to require).

The reason for this rule is not clear. It may be based upon the historical limitation contained in an action for trover at common law; or because plaintiff has the presumed ability to enter the marketplace with the sum awarded and purchase another product; or perhaps upon the theory that in recovering the full value of the vehicle as of the date of destruction, the owner has been made whole.

See Brujis v. Shaw, 876 F.Supp. 975, 978 (N.D.Ill.1995). As noted, the fiduciary shield denies personal jurisdiction if the individual’s actions were “solely on behalf of his employer.” Rice, 38 F.3d at 912.

"Loschiavo for the proposition that § 1983 could be used to enforce regulations “which have the force of law”). The current Sixth Circuit precedent treats regulations as “laws” under § 1983 and looks to determine whether the regulation at issue creates rights. In essence, regulations are treated in the same manner as statutes for purposes of determining whether they create new enforceable rights under § 1983. A such, district courts in the Sixth Circuit must determine, just as with federal statutes, whether federal regulations presented by § 1983 plaintiffs create enforceable rights. This court questions whether the Sixth Circuit’s rule can be correct in light of the Supreme Court’s decisions in Alexander v. Sandoval and Gonzaga University v. Doe.

Id. Miller argues that this is the dilemma he faced. Before addressing the tactical dilemma issue, it must first be noted that, although .the First Circuit has adopted an exception to Rule 51(c)(2), many circuits that have addressed similar issues have declined to do so.

Moreover, death is also bodily injury under the plain meaning of the Penal Code because it is an “impairment of physical condition.” See Tex. Pen.Code § 1.07(a)(8). In proving appellant caused the complainant’s death, the State necessarily had to prove that appellant caused bodily injury to the complainant. See Cumbie v.

"District of Pennsylvania under 28 U.S.C. § 2241, arguing that the BIA violated his due process rights and erred in determining that he was not eligible for cancellation of removal. He also sought the opportunity to apply for protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture (“CAT”). The District Court denied Gerbier’s request for habeas relief, finding that the BIA had properly determined that Gerbier was an aggravated felon and, thus, ineligible for cancellation of removal. The District Court permitted Gerbier to apply for protection under CAT, but Gerbier subsequently declined this opportunity. This timely appeal followed. The District Court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2241. See INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 2287, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001) (<HOLDING>).

The court in that case was not faced with an issue like that in the present case, where the arbitrator interpreted a provision of the LCA and a party challenged the arbitrator’s interpretation. Thus, Cooper Natural Resources does not support Continental’s position that a more searching review of an arbitrator’s interpretation of an LCA is mandated. Second, none of the authorities relied upon by the court in Cooper Natural Resources support a “no deference” standard of review for awards arising from LCAs. In Tootsie Roll Indus., Inc. v.

However, we will have no duty to defend an “insured” against any “suit” seeking “damages” for a “wrongful act” to which this insurance does not apply.

Because § 1651 does not constitute a grant of jurisdiction, but instead merely empowers federal courts to issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of respective jurisdiction, and because it would not have jurisdiction over McVeigh’s anticipated Rule 60(b) motion, the district court concluded that it must deny McVeigh’s request for a stay.

To focus unduly on the Bailey decision without giving fill attention to the purposes of collateral review is to lose the forest in all the trees. After Teague, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has not addressed whether changes in substantive statutory law should be applied retroactively. A close reading of Teague and an examination of its reasoning demonstrate that Teague should have a broader, more expansive application than it is usually afforded. Teague greatly restricted the availability of collateral relief, and it is applicable even in death penalty cases. Penry v.

Although Baker’s conviction and sentence were affirmed on appeal, the Second District found at least some merit in Baker’s ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims, noting that “evidence presented at trial could have supported an instruction for [the lesser included offense of] aggravated assault” had counsel requested one, and that counsel had called a witness whose testimony “was not helpful to the defense.” Cf. id. at 287 (<HOLDING>). 2.

By its terms, the OTCA establishes when the state and its subdivisions must expend public funds to address tort claims. Through the amendment of ORS 30.285 and ORS 30.287 in 1975, the legislature expanded the OTCA to require the state and its subdivisions to take financial responsibility for tort claims filed against their employees. Indeed, the Supreme Court has explicitly held that ORS 30.287 is directed to “torts, [and] not to other claims.” City of Tualatin v. City-County Ins.

Hyundai never had a joint ownership interest with any of the alleged joint venturers in the property of the Rus-sells or the McLemore group upon the closings on the property. Additionally, Hyundai did not provide financing for the purchase of the property, and it had no risk or expenses with regard to the purchase.

The Court agrees with the reasoning in Dellaripa, and this Court does not construe Dooley to supersede Dellaripa. First, the Court notes that the categories of beneficiaries established in sections 51 and 59 are identical. Accordingly, this Court would be in direct conflict with Van Beeck if it determined that the estate of a statutory beneficiary qualified as a “new” class of beneficiary. Second, other courts have reached similar conclusions about the sur-vivorship of claims where the named beneficiary dies during the pendency of the action. See, e.g., White v.

The circuit court, however, found that Minehan was not in custody for purposes of Miranda, a finding we uphold after examining several cases and closely reading the transcript of the interrogation.

In addition, Siemens has stated that when installation services are provided, “they are part and parcel of the contract for sale of equipment to the customer.” These are clear indications that Siemens has provided recurrent work for installation services as defined by the Kentucky courts.

Sherman & Fletcher, 705 S.W.2d 459, 462 (Ky.1986) (finding that “a person who engages another to perform a part of the work which is a recurrent part of his business, trade, or occupation is a contractor”).

Even if we were to agree with the Martins that NUFIC failed to provide adequate notice of a substantial reduction of coverage in this case, the appellants would nonetheless be unsuccessful. Although NUFIC’s earlier claims-made policy did not contain explicit exclusions for acts of sexual and physical abuse, such acts, nonetheless, are not covered as a matter of public policy.

Kinman states in her affidavit that initially she did not welcome McDougall’ F.3d 1006 (5th Cir.1996) (refusing to hold school district Hable for student-on-student harassment unless the school itself directly discriminated based on sex). The divergence of views on this issue stems in part from the factual disparity in the cases. Title IX cases vary in both the type of discrimination alleged (hostile environment, quid pro quo, sexual abuse, discriminatory hiring/firing, or some combination) and in the identity of the perpetrators and victims (teacher/student harassment, stu dent/student harassment, or school official/teacher harassment).

"waive” the alleged error). We discern no plain error. Viewed in context of the entire trial, see United States v. Christians, 200 F.3d 1124, 1128 (8th Cir.1999), it is not clear or obvious that the prosecutor was commenting indi rectly on Kieffer’s failure to testify. Kieffer was attempting to convince the jury that the Ninth Circuit’s decision to admit Kieffer to practice somehow relieved Kieffer of responsibility for his own deceitful conduct. In stating Kieffer was “not accepting ... responsibility,” the prosecutor apparently was rebutting Kieffer’s defense. The prosecutor probably was deflecting Kieffer’s attempt to shift blame, emphasizing the District of North Dakota’s attorney admission system was based on trust and the jury should not “lose sight of who is on trial.” Cf. id.

Consequently, the inquiry here is whether Plaintiffs argument that Defendant actually is not a municipality, and thus the punitive damages immunity is inapplicable, is valid.

"fully accept this principle but find it inapplicable here. Where the indictment includes, as here, specific, narrowing language “descriptive of the offense charged,” we cannot treat it as immaterial “surplusage.” Commonwealth v.

The defendant does not argue that, by denying admission, he did not “wilfully impede or obstruct” the inspector. Cf. District of Columbia v. Little, 339 U.

The district courts in Kinder, Reese, and Osborne also made determinations that the language was not jurisdictional.

"that the first part of MCL 600.5851(7) establishes a specific time in which a person under the age of eight must file a claim, with Miller, supra at 202, which defines a statute of limitations as a statute requiring a person to bring a claim within a specified time. In other words, statutes like MCL 600.5851(1) and MCL 600.5852 contain language that “saves” a claim that may otherwise be barred, while the language within MCL 600.5851(7) “gives” two distinct periods in which this particular class of claimants may file suit. Thus, the plain language of MCL 600.5851(7) provides an alternative limitations period (the tenth-birthday rule) that, depending on the facts of a particular case, may provide a plaintiff with more time than the “general” two-year period to sue.

Heeding this mandate, some prevailing case law inclined to the pleading leniency Conley demanded. In securities fraud cases, despite the particularity required by Fed.R.Civ.P. 9(b) for averments constituting the circumstances of the fraud asserted and the scienter requirement Hochfelder propounded, some courts permitted generalized pleadings or relaxed specificity of the requisite fraudulent intent to survive motions to dismiss, relying for authority on the language of Rule 9(b) itself, which provides that “malice, intent, knowledge, and other condition of mind, may be averred generally”. See In re GlenFed, Inc. Sec. Litig., 42 F.3d 1541, 1547 (9th Cir.1994) (en banc) (<HOLDING>); see also Cosmas, 886 F.2d at 12 (noting that"

Defendant argues, however, that in Title VII retaliation cases, “generally the passage of time ... tends to negate the infer- enee of discrimination.” Price, 380 F.3d at 213; see also Dowe, 145 F.3d at 657 (<HOLDING>).

"The High Court has explicitly affirmed that voir dire is a critical stage of the criminal proceeding, during which the defendant has a constitutional right to be present. Gomez v.

The determination that voir dire is a critical stage of trial flows directly from the recognition that a defendant’s “life or liberty may depend upon the aid which, by his personal presence, he may give to counsel and to the court and triers in the selection of jurors.” Lewis, supra at 373, 13 S.Ct. 136. However, certain decisions regarding the conduct of voir dire are properly made by counsel alone. See, e.g., Gonzalez v.

"for Indemnity. H. Economic Loss Doctrine Defendant argues that an essential element of each of Plaintiffs tort-based causes of action is an injury or damage proximately caused by Defendant’s tortious conduct. Defendant asserts that for each tort-based cause of action, the economic loss rule bars recovery because Plaintiff has not put forth evidence showing tangible, physical injury to the Wellfield. Under Ohio law, the economic loss rule “prevents recovery in tort of damages for purely economic losses. The well-established general rule is that a plaintiff who has suffered only economic loss due to another’s negligence has not been injured in a manner which is legally cognizable or compensable.” Ashtabula River Corp.

This count of the complaint fails to state a claim because after dismissal of the substantive claims there is no underlying legal action upon which to Plaintiff may receive declaratory or injunctive relief. It is well settled that an injunction is a remedy. A claim for injunctive relief does not stand alone, but requires a viable underlying legal claim. The same is true for declaratory relief, the source of which in federal court is the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201 et seq. See Collin County, Texas v.

In the final analysis, despite the government’s attempts to paint them as innocuous, the district court’s comments are pointed and reflect a belief that the court lacked discretion to depart downward.

"of alimony, maintenance, or support.” The argument is unpersuasive as an initial matter because nothing in the language of section 523(a)(5) indicates that the dis-chargeability of an obligation turns on state laws regulating alimony and support. Had Congress intended. state law to be determinative, it likely would have stated that intent expressly. See Harrell, 754 F.2d at 904 (“If Congress had intended dischargeability to be determined by whether an obligation could be imposed under state law, it might have addressed dischargeability in those terms.”).

Section 3 — 106, unlike section 3— 102, contemplates liability only if the governmental unit or employee acts in a willful and wanton manner.

For the reasons that follow, we find that the circuit court was correct in summarily denying all but one of Bearden’s claims. I. Bearden contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to render the judgment or to impose the sentence. He makes two arguments in this regard. First, Bearden contends that the circuit court lacked jurisdiction because, he says, the affidavit submitted in support of the warrant for his arrest was not properly verified. Although couched in jurisdictional terms, this claim does not present a jurisdictional issue. See, e.g., Sumlin v. State, 710 So.2d 941 (Ala.Crim.App.1998) (<HOLDING>). Therefore, we agree with the circuit court"

In his sentencing position paper, Escalon-Velasquez did not argue that a within-Guidelines sentence would waste government resources. His counsel raised the issue only at the end of his presentation, stating cursorily that “the resources that we would expend in incarcerating him any longer than necessary for him to be — for him to be deported should also be taken into consideration.” (Sentencing Hr’g Tr. 14.)

If, as appellant argues, a lessor could avoid liability simply by disclaiming liability in the lease without including such a disclaimer in the recorded short form, the purpose behind section 713.10(1) would be frustrated. Furthermore, section 713.10(2), which mandates that a notice regarding multiple leases on a parcel of land include the specific language contained in the various leases prohibiting a lessor’s liability, supports our interpretation of section 713.10(1).

Although citing the Frye general acceptance standard, our primary concern in Mack was with the unreliability of memories produced while under hypnosis. See Mack, 292 N.W.2d at 768-69. As a result, the test for admissibility of novel scientific evidence in Minnesota developed into the two-prong Frye-Mack standard. First, a novel scientific technique must be generally accepted in the relevant scientific community, and second, the particular evidence derived from that test must have a foundation that is scientifically reliable.

Alternatively, Campbell argues that the language of the insurance policy is ambiguous. Campbell relies on a number of other states’ cases addressing first-party contract claims, wherein the courts have concluded |isthat coverage for diminished value is required either because of the plain meaning of the policy language or based on a finding that the language is ambiguous.

Thus, these courts have viewed “complete preemption” as a prerequisite to the application of the “artful pleading doctrine”.

Thus, if the possession is not in the “usual course of the registrant’s lawful professional practice,” then it is not in the legitimate chain of possession and therefore not within the § 822(c) exception.

"recommendations respecting plan administration is not indicative of fiduciary status. Toomey, 855 F.Supp. at 24; 29 C.F.R. § 2509.75-8(D-2). The Court concludes, therefore, that John Hancock’s performance of plan design services lacks the discretionary authority in the administration of an employee benefit plan necessary to qualify it as a fiduciary under ERISA. Turning to an analysis of the other services John Hancock provides to the Plan, the Court recognizes that urging the purchase of an insurance company’s plan services does not make that company a fiduciary with respect to those services.

As discussed above, the balance of these equities favors a construction of the Eleventh Amendment that would permit a debtor to assert a permissive counterclaim capped by a setoff limitation against a state that has filed a proof of claim.

It is in light of this historic and statutory backdrop that we must consider the nature of our review of the Supreme Court of the Virgin Islands’ decisions. At the outset, we identify three possible standards of review that we might apply to a decision of the Virgin Islands Supreme Court. First, we might define our role as that of a “super-Supreme Court,” with powers of review equivalent to that of a state Supreme Court reviewing the decision of an intermediary state appellate court. Second, our role might be framed as equivalent to that of the United States Supreme Court when it reviews decisions of a state Supreme Court. See, e.g., Oregon v.

Second, even if a state’s highest court would not construe Plaintiffs’ claims as “product liability” claims, the claims were still properly dismissed if we predict that such courts would hold that the Brand Manufacturers do not owe users of generic drugs a duty that can give rise to liability.

The appellant argues that a farm tractor is a dangerous instrumentality because the legislature defines a farm tractor as a “motor vehicle” and extensively regulates their use. This argument is without merit. Although a farm tractor meets the statutory definition of a “motor vehicle,” at least three of our sister courts have held that statutory definitions of “motor vehicle” are not controlling in determining whether a device is a dangerous instrumentality.

And even if this evidence is probative, an important question still must be asked: whether the prejudicial effect of admitting the prior crime substantially outweighs its probative value. Although McWatters does not support the view that the prior kidnapping was relevant, I recognize that the prior kidnapping may be relevant under the case law relied upon by the trial court below in allowing the evidence.

Indeed, because NRDC did not file a separate action to challenge the 2009-10 specifications, the Fifth Amended Complaint challenged those specifications for the first time ever, in this case or any other.

It is therefore highly questionable whether the Property’s use as a club was subordinate to its use as a restaurant. However, the use of the Property as a venue for its patrons to engage in sexual activity is certainly not customary and incidental to its use as a restaurant.

We conclude that this determination was an unreasonable determination of the facts because the prosecutor failed to offer any credible justification for striking Jurors 016 and 019. First, we note that the prosecutor consistently identified Jurors 016 and 019 as “both young.” However, the record re veals that Juror 019 was at least a middle-aged grandmother. Indeed, Juror 019 informed the court that she was a retired nurse with seven grown children, the youngest of which had five children of her own. A prosecutor supplied with this information could not credibly identify Juror 019 as young. This incorrect factual statement supports Collins’ argument that the prosecutor was not credible.

Even if, as Sentry urges, “manifest” could be taken also to mean “discovered,” there would be, at most, an ambiguity in the meaning of “manifest” in this case, because “discoverable,” as shown supra, is at the very least an equally plausible definition of the term.

"Scott (1931) 113 Cal.App. Supp. 778, 783 [296 P. 601].) A dissolute person is one who is “ ‘indifferent to moral restraint’ ” and “ ‘given over to dissipation. . . .’ ” (People v. Jaurequi, supra, 142 Cal.App.2d 555, 560.)

Municipal Court (1974) 40 Cal.App.3d 733, 741 [115 Cal.Rptr. 479].)

The preliminary injunction was later vacated by this Court. Harris v. Pinewood Dev. Corp., 176 N.C. App. 704, 707-08, 627 S.E.2d 639, 642 (2006) (<HOLDING>).

In Milhollin, the question for decision was whether under TILA, as well as Regulation Z, the existence of an acceleration clause must be disclosed on the face of a credit agreement.

"A lie does not become the truth simply because the person hearing it knows that it is a lie. The premise underlying this argument reveals the true nature of the matic because they are effectively invoking estoppel against the government.

Specifically, this interest was considered legitimate because parolees are more likely to commit crimes in the future, and expeditious supervisory measures are required in order to prevent parolees from having the opportunity to “anticipate searches and conceal criminality.” Id. at 2201. This rationale finds foundation in the impracticability of obtaining a search warrant, a rationale similar to the underlying motivation used to support the administrative or “special needs” exception.

We thus hold that wills should be construed by the law as it existed when the testator died, thereby excluding adopted children as beneficiaries unless the will indicates an intent to include adopted children. In the instant case, the probate court determined that Jenkins did not intend to include his daughters’ adopted children as beneficiaries of his testamentary trust. In making its determination, the probate court considered the law as it existed in 1944, when Jenkins executed his will. At that time, Colorado law presumed that adopted children were not included as beneficiaries unless the testator expressly included the term “adopted children” in the will. See Brunton v.

We agree with the trial court that a parent’s decision to deprive a child of contact with someone who has no legal custody or visitation rights vis-á-vis the child is an inadequate ground upon which to base an adjudication of dependency.

As defendants here correctly point out, however, the impact of the considered and settled decision in Miles is to render it anomalous to award the nondependent survivor of a nonseaman a recovery which is patently denied to the nondependent beneficiary of a well-deserving seaman. In effect, to allow plaintiffs to recover wrongful death damages here simply because their son was not a Jones Act seaman would ironically, and improperly, leave the relatives of seamen as a less-favored class under admiralty.

Thus, absent a finding of good cause, Brown was obligated to pay post-judgment interest from on or about November 2, 2007, to the date when the sums ordered in the divorce judgment were fully paid in 2008.

Thus, it appears that Figueroa’s Title VII claims of sexual harassment and hostile work environment have not been under the scrutiny of the EEOC; as such, allowing Figueroa to intervene with them would probably prove futile.

Mother has a gross monthly income of $23,451, including her salary, alimony, and child support. She has over $5 million in savings. Mother’s payment of the attorney’s fees and costs would not affect her standard of living in any meaningful way. Accordingly, we affirm the award of attorney’s fees. See Whetstone v.

"original sentence hearing went no further than “at least 1.5 kilograms.” If so, that finding is not specific enough to support any conclusion about whether Amendment 750 lowered Hamilton’s base offense level, because “at least 1.5 kilograms” is equally consist tent with a finding of 8.4 kilograms or more and a finding of less than 8.4 kilograms. So if the district court finds that its original findings were limited to “at least 1.5 kilograms,” the court will need to go further. It will need to examine the entire record before it at the time of the original sentencing to see if it can make any further findings that will resolve the issue of whether 8.4 kilograms or more of crack cocaine should be attributed to Hamilton.

"which Hinton and Wachovia agreed states that if Hinton breaches, Wachovia is entitled to foreclose on the property. On this basis, Wachovia contends that it was entitled to reject Hinton’s October payment and initiate foreclosure proceedings on the home.

Hinton cites no authority for this proposition, and we have found none. An ambiguous term in the contract does not amount to a breach by the drafter.

"in bankruptcy. As of November 23, 2005, the Debtor owed the Creditor approximately $114,040. A debtor cannot claim an exemption against amounts owed on a secured debt that represents a voluntary encumbrance of property; consequently, the Debtor is not entitled to any exemption in the $114,040 owed to the Creditor. Because the Debtor’s principal residence was sold for $130,000, the Debtor’s entitlement to an exemption based on the transfer sought to be avoided was only $15,960.

"statutory sodomy, and it does pot consist of an attempt to commit the latter offense. Thus, first-degree sexiial misconduct as defined by section 566.090 does not satisfy any of the subparts of section 566.046.1(2) and therefore is not a lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy. Our holding is consistent with State v. Greenlee, 327 S.W.3d 602, 621 (Mo.App. E.D. 2010), in which this Court held that first-degree sexual misconduct, as defined by section 566.090 is not a.lesser included offense of first-degree statutory sodomy because the former requires proof of “lack of consent.” Id. Ward’s argument is based entirely on the principle that a person under the age of fourteen can never legally consent to any kind of sexual activity. State v.

If she wanted to pursue these arguments, she should have appealed her termination, as she had every right to do for a fee of $100. Because Mitchell knowingly failed to avail herself of that right, the agency’s stated reason for terminating her—which is entirely understandable and reasonable on its face—should not be subject to question. See Wright v.

The district court did not reach the defendants' other arguments for dismissal, including Best Buy and Speakeasy’s argument that RTI’s claim that they “assisted” in filing the California Action did not satisfy the plausibility standard for pleading, see Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678-80, 129 S.Ct. 1937, and the Covad Defendants’ argument that they were not bound by the Agreement. Because we affirm the district court's dismissal under Lear, we do not reach these arguments. 5 . Cf. Aro Corp. v. Allied Witan Co., 531 F.2d 1368, 1374 (6th Cir.1976) (<HOLDING>). 6 .

"he hesitate to answer questions at any time.” The trial court made extensive findings of fact in accord with this evidence. Defendant did not except to any of these findings. Id. The Court then held that “[f]rom these findings the trial court correctly concluded that the statement ‘was made freely, voluntarily, understanding [sic] and knowingly ....’” Id. at 20, 277 S.E.2d at 529. The Court concluded, therefore, that the trial court properly admitted the defendant’s incriminating statements. In this case, the trial court made comparable findings based on similar evidence. Under McCoy, therefore, the trial court’s findings in this case support its conclusion that defendant’s three statements were voluntary and admissible. See also State v. McKoy, 323 N.C. 1, 17, 372 S.E.2d 12, 20 (1988) (<HOLDING>), vacated on other grounds, 494 U.S. 433, 108"

Third, a plaintiff is required to provide the amount, date, and place of each payment to be refunded, as well as a copy of the refund claim, when filing a refund suit in the United States Court of Federal Claims.
