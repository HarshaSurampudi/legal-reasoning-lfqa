If Dr. Nadel had been unwilling to do so, defendants could not have compelled his testimony. See Graham v.

"one of his trial counsel as a witness, so the record is altogether silent about what the other trial counsel knew and did not know. And even as to the trial counsel who did testify at the hearing, Appellee never asked him what he knew, and what he did not know, about the testimony that family members might give. That trial counsel was unable to recall some details of his discussions with the family is unsurprising, considering that the hearing was held more than a decade after the trial, and it is unavailing to Appellee in any event. As noted earlier, a silent or ambiguous record is not sufficient to overcome the presumption of reasonable performance, and it is Appellee’s burden to make a complete and clear record. See Whatley v. Terry, 284 Ga. 555, 566 (V) (A) (668 SE2d 651) (2008) (<HOLDING>); see also Chandler, 218 F3d at 1314, n. 15."
"Some of Cruikshank’s objections on appeal appear meritorious, even though the record does not show they were presented to the trial court. For example, Cruikshank contends on appeal the trial court improperly excluded statements as hearsay when, in fact, they were not hearsay because the statements were admissions by a party opponent. But these complaints are not timely. “As a prerequisite to presenting a complaint for appellate review, the record must show that: (1) the complaint was made to the trial court by a timely request, objection, or motion....” Tex.R.App. P. 33.1(a).

Third-Party Defendants’ Brief at 9 n. 9. PFM argues that it is really a motion for summary judgment.

"many seemingly anomalous situations. For example, mandatory withdrawal would be required whenever there is a challenge to the court’s subject matter jurisdiction under § 1334. 196 B.R. 791 (N.D.Ind.1995). In re Rimsat, Our conclusion that the' Tucker Act does not regulate “organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce” within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. § 157(d) is in harmony with other decisions involving federal laws of a jurisdictional nature.

Clark, to be sure, rejected a challenge to a legislative veto provision as unripe because the provision had not been exercised. But Clark involved a naked attack upon the provision itself and not, like the present case, a challenge to present use of the statutory powers to which the provision was attached. And Muller, which did address a challenge comparable to the present case, implicitly rejects rather than supports intervenors’ ripeness argument, deciding on the merits a claim that the existence of an unexercised legislative veto provision in a statute rendered actions taken under that statute unconstitutional.

To survive a 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, the allegations in the complaint must meet the standard of “plausibility.” See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 1970, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Although the complaint need not provide “detailed factual allegations,” id. at 1964; see also ATSI Commc’ns v.

Federal courts routinely dismiss claims attacking a verdict as against the weight of the evidence on the basis that they are not federal constitutional issues cognizable in a habeas proceeding.

"rate that is added to the total amount of commissions earned. As such, NHC’s nonrecoverable draw functions much more like a salary than a true draw on commissions. Regardless of whether the Level I plan constitutes a salary plus commission, a quota bonus plan, or a hybrid of both, the pre-determined compensation referred to by the Defendant as a “non-recoverable draw” does not represent commissions. To the contrary, in light of the way that compensation actually functions, it represents a salary. Therefore, this portion of the account executives’ compensation cannot be taken into account when determining whether more than fifty percent of the Plaintiffs’ earnings represent commission, as is required to qualify for the retail-service exemption.

"plaintiffs are not entitled to relief. If the facts alleged here can be proved, this case is similar to Lankford v. Gelston, 364 F.2d 197 (4th Cir.1966) (en banc), in which injunctive relief under § 1983 was granted against the defendant Police Commissioner because the wholesale raids in violation of the Fourth Amendment were the “effectuation of a plan conceived by high ranking [police] officials,” a practice which in the interim the defendant had “renounced only obliquely, if at all,” and as to which “the danger of repetition has not been removed.” Id. at 202, 204.

On appeal, Defendants cite to the magistrate judge’s statement and argue that this Court should not entertain on appeal Cummings’ claim for unlawful entry. We disagree. As an initial matter, the magistrate judge’s decision not to address the claim is irrelevant to the question of whether this Court may address it on appeal. We apply a “course of the proceedings” test to determine whether defendants in a § 1983 action have received notice of the plaintiffs claims where the complaint is ambiguous. Moore v.

As between the employer and the employee, all other common law and statutory actions are barred by the Act. Id., 94 N.M. at 61, 607 P.2d at 599. The reasoning of the Michigan Court in Beauchamp is inconsistent with the language of Section 52-1-9 and prior decisions of both our Supreme Court and this Court. Moreover, following the decision in Beau-champ, the Michigan Legislature amended its statute so as to legislatively reject the “substantial-certainty standard” recognized by the Illinois Court.

Moreover, the district court gave Carman"
"an interpreter when, other than having some syntactical errors, his testimony was “very responsive” and “indicative of [his] ability to speak and understand English.”). Additionally, and as noted by the trial court in its denial of Nur’s motion for a new trial, neither Nur nor his attorney ever requested an interpreter; Nur communicated with the court in English, both orally and in writing; and the evidence at trial showed that Nur communicated with native English speakers in English when orchestrating the crime. Thus, based on the record, we cannot say that the court had notice that Nur had a significant language difficulty. As such, the court’s failure to appoint an interpreter on its own motion was not fundamental error. See, e.g., Martinez v. State, 451 N.E.2d 39, 41 (Ind.1983) (<HOLDING>).

Pinchak, 294 F.3d 492, 498 (3d Cir.2002). District courts may utilize this power to appoint counsel at the request of the plaintiff or may do so sua sponte if the court finds appointment appropriate as the case moves forward. Generally, the Third Circuit has interpreted § 1915 to grant district courts broad discretionary power in determining whether counsel should or should not be appointed. Tabron v.

The district court held a lengthy colloquy with Rizo, where the court advised Rizo that he was waiving his right to a jury trial.

Nevertheless, because the Fifth Circuit said in Williams that the Constitution prevents Congress from suspending the writ of habeas corpus for the class of criminal deportees to which Olvera belongs, 114 F.3d at 84, the court must assume that habeas jurisdiction is constitutionally required in this case despite the language of section 440(a). III. Scope of Review Among the district courts that have found jurisdiction to review deportation orders under § 2241, there has been considerable debate over the proper scope of review.

"aggravating circumstances, at least one of which must be found to exist beyond a reasonable doubt before a sentence of death can be imposed, includes a finding that “[t]he murder was especially heinous, atrocious or cruel, manifesting exceptional depravity.” The trial judge in Pizzuto’s case found that this factor, along with four others, existed beyond a reasonable doubt. The petitioner asserts that this aggravating factor is unconstitutionally vague.

Not only did Moody volunteer that he had been placed in a juvenile facility, but he also voluntarily differentiated his juvenile facility from that of the Indiana Boy’s School.

Hawking's share of tract ten was a mere 1/120th interest in that thirteen and one-third acres. We fail to see how unity of title could exist when Hawkins owned a one hundred percent interest in tracts four, five, and eight, but owned less than a one percent interest in tract ten. Finally, an easement of necessity arises, if ever, only at the time that the parcel is divided and only becaus ite unity of title required for implication of an easement of necessity, we need not determine whether Cockrell established the required necessity.

"S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The right at issue in habeas cases, in other words, is not the same right as that at issue in § 1983 cases. In § 1983 cases, it is the constitutional right itself that forms the basis of the claim. In habeas cases, in contrast, it is the right not to be held in custody in violation of the Constitution that lies at the core of the suit. This is no mere difference in semantics. Where a petitioner asserts the violation of a constitutional right — indeed, even one so fundamental as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures — but the violation did not contribute to the custody of the petitioner, the Court has held that such a claim is not cognizable on habeas.

It is thus possible to view the consequences of this error in one of two ways: either the defendant was improperly sentenced to a greater penalty than the one authorized by Congress for the crime of which he was justly convicted, or the defendant was improperly convicted, because the crime.of conviction was not fully alleged in the indictment and found by the jury.

The fact that plaintiff not only expressed the grievance to his immediate supervisor, but also to the entity ultimately responsible for the proper functioning of the police department is simply further evidence that this speech was not citizen speech; rather, the Memorandum — whether required or not— was clearly pursuant to his duties as a police officer.

"Report Ex. 15. Despite Strougo’s contentions and as demonstrated by the SLC’s Final Report, the SLC pursued its investigation in a thorough and diligent manner. From June through December 1998, the SLC interviewed 11 witnesses and conducted a comprehensive review of approximately 36,000 pages of documents. The SLC requested documents from Defendants throughout the course of its investigation and prepared memoranda of its interviews and meetings. The SLC’s Report and the five volumes of exhibits thereto outline the SLC’s reconstruction of the history of the events surrounding Strougo’s allegations, and the SLC’s findings and conclusions based on its efforts.

"this clause, Lefever contends that the trial court considered Hargrave’s motion before it entered its order. Relying upon North E. Indep. Sch. Dist. v. Aldridge, 400 S.W.2d 893, 895 (Tex.1966), Lefever asserts that the Mother Hubbard clause disposes of all issues that were before the trial court prior to its April order, including Hargrave’s motion. Aldridge stands for the general rule that for appeal purposes, it is presumed a trial court intended to dispose of all parties and issues before it when a judgment is rendered and entered in a case.

In addition, many individuals carry purses or shoulder bags to hold objects they wish to have with them. Containers such as these, while appended to the body, are so closely associated with the person that they are identified with and included within the concept of one’s person. To hold differently would be to narrow the scope of a search of one’s person to a point at which it would have little meaning. Id.

The words “fair” and “reasonable” indicate that the Secretary should use an objective standard when determining whether the negotiated ship price is acceptable, since to do otherwise would relegate each inquiry under the statute to a web of subjectivity and destroy the continuity and predictability of administration and enforcement.

Neighbors had reported that Espinoza lived alone, and no one reported seeing or hearing anyone besides Espinoza inside the house.

A reasonable fact-finder, however, could conclude that Irene had ample business reasons to travel to her home even in advance of an actual page.

Thus, the nature of the defendant’s prior felony convictions, which would have included the fact that the defendant had never used a weapon, threatened, or harmed anyone during the commission of these felonies, was relevant, and therefore, the trial court erred in precluding the defendant’s testimony.

However, even upon scrutiny, we find no basis to conclude that section 924(e)(1) violates the Eighth Amendment. Although Mitchell’s sentence is a severe punishment for felony gun possession, when viewed in the context of his three burglaries, it is no more severe than that found acceptable in Rummel v.

Here, the district court faced an unrepentant defendant, who absconded from the United States within a month of commencing his term of supervised release with a history of failing to comply with conditions of parole and probation. The court justified its sentence based on Angelo-Guarino’s inability to comply with the conditions of supervised release, suspicions regarding his explanations for his conduct, and the need to deter further criminal conduct and protect the public from future criminal conduct. Considering the testimony, evidence, and record before it, the district court did not abuse its discretion in imposing a sentence that exceeded the Guideline range. See United States v.

We conclude that it was reasonably foreseeable to Leonard Sapp that the conspiracy encompassed sales of crack cocaine of at least 50 grams. Because the district court’s factual findings support reasonable foreseeability, the error committed by the district court did not prejudice Leonard Sapp’s substantial rights and the district court did not plainly err.

Contrary to the majority’s conclusion, then, a review of the record shows there could have been a disparity between the movements of the parties during the trial that violated Earhart’s “Sixth Amendment right to act as his own attorney,” rebutting any factual determination to the contrary. See 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1). A violation of the Sixth Amendment right to conduct one’s own defense is a structural trial error not subject to the harmless-error rule; thus, whether Earhart was prejudiced is irrelevant in determining whether his movement restrictions violated his right to self-representation.

Accordingly, the insurance information, as well as the defendant’s name, address, and driver’s license number, was relevant to the jury’s determination of the driver’s identity.

We therefore agree with the State that Ross’s testimony constituted a waiver of the Rule 504 privilege in this case.

It was reasonable for the jury to infer that, had Appellant properly performed his duties, the accident would not have occurred.

The fact that other tenants had access to the basement does not alter the result.

In some respects, the CGL coverage is more limited than the CPPL coverage. For example, the CGL coverage requires an “occurrence,” defined as an “accident.” The CPPL coverage does not require an “occurrence.” The CGL coverage also contains an exclusion for bodily injury that is “expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.” The CPPL coverage does not contain an exclusion for expected or intended injuries. Finally, the CGL coverage applies to “bodily injury,” but the CPPL coverage applies to “injury.” “Bodily injury” is a narrower category than “injury.” See Trinity Universal Ins. Co. v.

In the present case, there were indictments issued on 29 March 2004 and superceding indictments issued on 27 February 2006. Sergeant Wyrick testified that defendant failed to appear for a court date on 6 February 2006. A warrant was issued for defendant’s arrest for the failure to appear. An electronic database confirmed that defendant had been arrested in Ohio, after which the district attorney’s office had defendant extradited back to North Carolina. The fact that defendant left the state and failed to appear for court can be construed as evidence of flight in this case. See State v. Williamson, 122 N.C.

Making a determination under U.S.S.G. § 4B1.4(b)(3)(A) involves a two-step inquiry. First, the court must decide whether the predicate offense is a violent felony. Second, the court must consider whether the defendant used or possessed a firearm in connection with that violent predicate offense. In making the first inquiry, the court is to employ “a formal categorical approach” irrespective of the actual factual circumstances of the underlying offense. Taylor v.

At oral argument the University contended that these statements are more appropriately considered performance related, and even if they are believed, show an aversion toward age not gender.

Because the award of penalties is committed to the sound discretion of the Court, I must determine whether Moskow-itz’s conduct warrants imposition of such a penalty. In determining whether to assess a penalty under § 1132(c)(1) courts have considered such factors as bad faith or intentional conduct on the part of the administrator, the length of the delay, the number of requests made and documents withheld, and the existence of any prejudice to the participant or beneficiary.

It did not attribute Jose’s killing to any particular actor when the evidence showed that the actor could have been Samuel individually,, appellant individually, or both acting in concert. Second, the possibility that Samuel was the true killer meant that the jury did have a vehicle to acquit. Indeed, that vehicle remained possible in part because appellant did not take the stand and admit to the killing herself. Likewise, defense counsel could have invoked a claim of Self-defense in an opening statement, but by waiving an opening statement, counsel left the jury with the more difficult task of deciding for itself who was responsible for the killing., See id. at 455 (<HOLDING>).

Sluder’s and Saturday’s sentences, even after the loss enhancement, fall within the maximum sentence authorized for the crimes alleged in the indictment.

However, if the covenant is clearly separated into parts and some parts are reasonable and others are not, the contract may be held divisible. The reasonable restrictions may then be enforced.

The police conduct was heinous if the testimony is believed, and it is understandable that the female petitioner may have been reluctant to discuss such a degrading experience if it occurred.

These restrictions conflict with the wide range of light work the ALJ found Ulloa capable of performing. However, the ALJ never explained why Dr. DePhillips’ or Dr. Segura’s opinions were not entitled to controlling weight.

Two caveats must accompany the League court’s articulation of what constitutes an adequate discussion of mitigation measures under the Compact. First, while NEPA caselaw may provide persuasive authority for interpreting the Compact, it is not controlling. Under NEPA, the duty to study possible mitigation measures stems from the statute’s requirement that the unavoidable adverse effects of a project be studied. See Robertson v.

In contrast with this discretionary language stands the statutory command that any order revoking a confirmation order “shall — (1) contain such provisions as are necessary to protect any entity acquiring rights in good faith reliance on the order of confirmation.... ” The use of the imperative “shall” leaves no room for discretion.

"recognition proved to be the answer to the question presented in Government of the Virgin Islands v. Smith, 615 F.2d 964, 17 V.I. 623 (3d Cir. 1980): If a defendant’s right to due process can be violated by strict rules of evidence that prevent a defendant from presenting clearly exculpatory evidence to the jury, can that same right also be violated by the failure to affirmatively grant immunity to an available defense witness who will not testify under grounds of self-incrimination when the witness is likely to offer clearly exculpatory testimony? Smith said “yes,” observing that the latter violation is “not different in substance than the violation found in Chambers.” Id. at 970. Indeed, cases like Chambers; Gideon v.

Under these circumstances, we do not believe the jury’s award of replacement cost at a level proposed by the plaintiffs expert was so far outside the range of evidence as to suggest the jury was motivated by passion.

As in Po-ohina, the District Court’s sua sponte dismissal of the charges was not based on a decision on the merits of the case or a decision as to the guilt of Clemente. Instead, the District Court dismissed the charges as a sanction against the State because the District Court mistakenly believed that the State’s witness, Officer Tallion, would not be appearing as ordered.

"camps have staked out three general positions on the use of an alleged violation of the ECOA after the statute of limitations has run. 1. Position # 1: A debtor can only asseH an ECOA violation as a counterclaim. A number of state and federal courts have held the only remedy provided for an ECOA violation is an offensive action for damages brought within two years of the violation. See 15 U.S.C. § 1691e(a), (b), (d), (f) (providing expressly for a civil cause of action for actual and punitive damages as well as attorney fees and costs against a creditor who violates the ECOA). Consequently, these courts have refused to recognize the validity of an ECOA violation asserted as an affirmative defense.

It authorizes payments to local governments according to a formula, but neither the statute nor applicable regulations suggest or imply remedies for local governments that receive less than their full allotments under the formula if Congress does not appropriate sufficient funds. Language in the case law speaking of “fair inferences” of a right to recover and readings of statutes that are “reasonably amenable” to money damages, suggest that the standards may lean slightly in a claimant’s favor. However, we cannot read this statute to mandate compensation or to imply that money damages would be due' in these circumstances. Cf. Britell v.

"Delta Airlines and Gary Richter contend that because Plaintiffs breach of contract claim arises out of events which occurred during the course of embarkation of an international flight, her claim is preempted by the Montreal Convention.

See SMM 3259.7(B)(1) Note. Wong has not invoked this rule, see Appellant’s Br. at 34, and we therefore need not determine whether the Social Security Act's anti-alienation provision would prevent Wong from irrevocably assigning his SSDI income to a Special Needs Trust in this way.

Given Gasser’s testimony that at the conclusion of the meeting he felt that Infanti would comply with the agreement, and that he saw no evidence that Infanti was not complying with the agreement until 1986, a reasonable inference would be that Gasser had no reason to sue until at least 1986, a difference in the delay period that might well have made a difference in the final outcome.

We note that there is no possibility of such a rule for automobile searches, because the Supreme Court has already authorized this type of container search in that context.

Although the question is not free from doubt, we believe that not all out-of-court contempt proceedings are fatally flawed by the failure to appoint a prosecutor. Where, as here, the judge is impartial and the evidence is so simple that the judge is not diverted from the role of impartial judge and factfinder, we are not convinced that a prosecutor must be appointed.

Before the Trustee conducted the sale, he provided notice to the Debtor that conformed with Rule 2002(c)(1), and the matter came on for hearing. Nevertheless, the Debtor never raised any objection to the proposed sale of the Corvettes, and so, relying on the Trustee’s assertion that the sale was in the best interest of the estate and the lack of objections, the Court entered an order approving the sale. Having failed to object before the order was entered, the Debtor cannot now, dissatisfied with the outcome of the sale, engage in a collateral attack on the price obtained. See Hendrick v.

DECISION Because respondents’ remaining claims present a nonjusticiable political question, we reverse the district court’s order refusing to dismiss for lack of justiciability, without addressing appellants’ other assignments of error. Reversed. 1 . Although respondents supported their constitutional claims with allegations of segregation, respondents did not make a traditional segregation claim based on racial discrimination. Instead, respondents' claims are rooted in a purported right to an education of a certain quality under the Education Clause, Article XIII, section 1, of the Minnesota Constitution. A segregation claim based on racial discrimination is justiciable. See Brown v. Bd. of Educ., 347 U.S. 483, 495, 74 S.Ct. 686, 692, 98 L.Ed. 873 (1954) (<HOLDING>). 2 .

The plain language of the Limited Warranty thus implies that the date of the delivery of each Electric Mobility scooter and wheelchair, and not the date of the potentiometer installation, triggers the beginning of the warranty period. Quite plainly, the Defendants’ moving papers themselves demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. The interpretation of the Limited Warranty is a material fact since it is relevant as one factor in determining which damages were reasonably foreseeable to the Defendants. See e.g., Donovan v.

Because the accident occurred on June 1, 2000, more than twenty-eight years had passed since delivery of the helicopter to the first purchaser.

"N.J. 110, 792 A.2d 1222 (2000). In many ways, plaintiffs seek to base jurisdiction for their claims against these defendants on the in-forum contacts of plaintiffs own subsidiary, C & F. By this logic, defendants would be subject to jurisdiction in any forum in which plaintiff had a subsidiary. Imposing jurisdiction on such “random” and “fortuitous” grounds would undermine the due process considerations on which the minimum contacts analysis is based. See Waste Mgmt., supra, 138 N.J. at 121, 649 A.2d 379; see also Kulko v. Superior Ct. of Cal., 436 U.S. 84, 93-94, 98 S.Ct. 1690, 1698, 56 L.Ed.2d 132, 142 (1978). Indeed, such an exercise of personal jurisdiction is precluded by well-established due process principles. Walden, supra, 571 U.S. at 15, 134 S.Ct. at 1122, 188 L.Ed.2d at 21 (<HOLDING>). 4.

Jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1) The courts of appeals have jurisdiction over “[ijnterloeutory orders of the district courts ... granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions.” 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1). The Longliners assert that we have jurisdiction because the Consent Decree is, as the district court labeled it, an injunction. The Federal Agencies agree with the Longliners and also argue that we have jurisdiction. Turtle Island argues against jurisdiction on the grounds that the Consent Decree is a vacatur and remand.

(1) The following orders may be appealed from dependency-neglect proceedings: (A) adjudication order; (B) disposition, review, no reunification, and permanency planning order if the court directs entry of a final judgment as to one or more of the issues or parties based upon the express determination by the court supported by factual findings that there is no just reason for delay of an appeal, in accordance with Ark. R. Civ. P. Rule 54(b); (C) termination of parental rights; and (D) denial of right to appointed counsel pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. § 9-27-316(h). In Posey v.

Thus, based on our analysis of Williams’ sentence pursuant to the Solem objective criteria, we hold that 11 DelC. § 4214(b), as applied to Williams, does not impose an unconstitutionally disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment. Conclusion The judgments of the Superior Court, which resulted in Williams’ convictions and his sentencing as an habitual criminal, are AFFIRMED. 1 .

"First, the proposed Second Amended Complaint makes clear that Plaintiff was separated from her colleagues before she brought her discrimination claim to HR. See id. ¶ 17 (alleging that Groff “segregated” Plaintiff “[s]hortly after denying [her] request for a promotion”). Accordingly, there can be no causal relationship between her complaint to HR and that conduct. Second, Plaintiff does not specify when Defendant reduced her break time or subjected her attendance to more scrutiny, so the court cannot infer that those actions arose in response to her protected activity. In any event, even if those acts did commence after Plaintiff first exercised her statutory rights, they do not support a hostile work environment claim. See Veitch v.
